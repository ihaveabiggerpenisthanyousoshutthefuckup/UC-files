The lab topology shows an Internet cloud connecting to the R2 router via the Lo1 interface within the ISP AS 65001 cloud. The S0/0/1 interface on the R2 router within AS 65001 connects to the R3 S0/0/1 interface located in the Branch1 AS 65010 cloud. R3 also has a G0/1 LAN connected through port F0/5 on switch S3. The G0/0 interface on R2 in ISP AS 65001 cloud connects to port F0/18 on S2. S2 connects to S1 through port F0/1 on both switches. The S0/0/0 interface on the R2 router in the ISP AS 65001 cloud connects to the S0/0/0 interface on router R1 located in the Cust1 AS 65000 cloud. R1 has the loopback 1 interface connected. The G0/0 R1 interface connects to switch S1 through the F0/6 port. The G0/1 R1 interface connects to port F0/5 on switch S1. There is a tunnel drawn between R1 and R3 with the words BGP over GRE tunnel written on it. The connection between S1 and S2 is labeled BGP over PPPoE.
