Figures one through six are interactive media elements that allow the learner to check their understanding of A.C.L. statements. Figure 1 has a topology used for all of the figures. RTA has a LAN 10.10.1.0/24 through interface Gi0/1. The PC on this LAN is 10.10.1.1. S0/1/0 on RTA connects to S0/2/0 on RTC and is network 192.168.10.80/30. RTC has the 10.10.20.0/24 LAN available through the Gi0/1 interface. S0/1/0 on RTC connects to S0/2/0 on RTB. RTB has LAN 10.10.30.0/24 available through interface Gi0/0. PC 10.10.30.3 and F.T.P. server 10.10.30.2 reside on the RTB LAN. RTP connects to the internet through S0/1/1. The instructions are to click buttons 2 through 6 to complete the activity. Click button 1 to view the topology at any time. Figure 2 instructions Question 1 – A single access list needs to be created to deny the 10.10.1.0/24 network and the 10.10.20.0/24 network from reaching the 10.10.30.0/24 network. The host 10.10.1.1 should have access to the FTP server only. The rest of the 10.0.0.0 network should have access to the 10.10.30.0/24 network. All devices should be able to access the Internet. Click Button 3 to continue. The question is what should be the first line of the new access list described in the practice scenario? All answers are given from global configuration mode. The first option is access-list 10 deny 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255. The second option is access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 host 10.10.30.2. The third option is access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255. The last option is access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255. Figure 3 Question 2 – A single access list needs to be created to deny the 10.10.1.0/24 network and the 10.10.20.0/24 network from reaching the 10.10.30.0/24 network. The host 10.10.1.1 should have access to the F.T.P. server only. The rest of the 10.0.0.0 network should have access to the 10.10.30.0/24 network. All devices should be able to access the Internet. Click Button 4 to continue. The question is what should be the second line of the new access list? All answers are given from global configuration mode. The first option is access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 host 10.10.30.1. The second option is access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 host 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255. The third option is access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255. The last option is access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255 any. Figure 4 Question 3 – A single access list needs to be created to deny the 10.10.1.0/24 network and the 10.10.20.0/24 network from reaching the 10.10.30.0/24 network. The host 10.10.1.1 should have access to the FTP server only. The rest of the 10.0.0.0 network should have access to the 10.10.30.0/24 network. All devices should be able to access the Internet. Click Button 5 to continue. The question is what should be the third line of the new access list? Option 1: access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 host 10.10.30.1 e.q. f.t.p. Option 2: access-list 101 permit i.p. host 10.10.1.1 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255 e.q. any. Option 3: access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.10.20.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255 e.q. any. The last option contains access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.20.1.0 0.0.0.255 any. Figure 5 Question 4 – A single access list needs to be created to deny the 10.10.1.0/24 network and the 10.10.20.0/24 network from reaching the 10.10.30.0/24 network. The host 10.10.1.1 should have access to the FTP server only. The rest of the 10.0.0.0 network should have access to the 10.10.30.0/24 network. All devices should be able to access the Internet. Click Button 6 to continue. The activity poses the question what should be the fourth line of the new access list? Option 1 is access-list permit i.p. host 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255. Option 2 is access-list 101 permit i.p. 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255. Option 3 is access-list 101 permit i.p. 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any. Option 4 is access-list 101 deny i.p. 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255 10.10.30.0 0.0.0.255 e.q. any. Figure 6 Question 5 – A single access list needs to be created to deny the 10.10.1.0/24 network and the 10.10.20.0/24 network from reaching the 10.10.30.0/24 network. The host 10.10.1.1 should have access to the FTP server only. The rest of the 10.0.0.0 network should have access to the 10.10.30.0/24 network. All devices should be able to access the Internet. The activity asks where should the new access list be placed to ensure it is effective? Option 1 is S 0/2/0 on R.T.B. as an inbound list. Option 2 is G 0/0 on R.T.B. as an inbound list. Option 3 is G 0/1 on R.T.A. as an inbound list. Options 4 is G 0/1 on R.T.A. as an outbound list.
