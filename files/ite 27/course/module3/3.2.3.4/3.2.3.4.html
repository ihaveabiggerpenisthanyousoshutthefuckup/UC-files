        <h1>Link Types</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The link type provides a categorization for each port participating in RSTP by using the duplex mode on the port. Depending on what is attached to each port, two different link types can be identified:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Point-to-Point</b> - A port operating in full-duplex mode typically connects a switch to a switch and is a candidate for a rapid transition to a forwarding state.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Shared</b> - A port operating in half-duplex mode connects a switch to a hub that attaches multiple devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>In the figure, click each link to learn about the link types.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The link type can determine whether the port can immediately transition to a forwarding state, assuming certain conditions are met. These conditions are different for edge ports and non-edge ports. Non-edge ports are categorized into two link types: point-to-point and shared. The link type is automatically determined, but can be overridden with an explicit port configuration using the <b>spanning-tree link-type </b>{ <b>point-to-point</b> | <b>shared</b> } command. Characteristics of port roles, with regard to link types, include the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Edge port connections and point-to-point connections are candidates for rapid transition to a forwarding state. However, before the link-type parameter is considered, RSTP must determine the port role. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Root ports do not use the link-type parameter. Root ports are able to make a rapid transition to the forwarding state as soon as the port is in sync (receives a BPDU from the root bridge).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Alternate and backup ports do not use the link-type parameter in most cases. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designated ports make the most use of the link-type parameter. A rapid transition to the forwarding state for the designated port occurs only if the link-type parameter is set to <b>point-to-point</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
