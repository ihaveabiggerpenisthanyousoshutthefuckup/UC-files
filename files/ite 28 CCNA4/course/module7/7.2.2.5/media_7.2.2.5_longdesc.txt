Figure 1 shows an example of computer architecture abstraction layers. Starting at the bottom and working our way up we have Hardware (CPU, Memory, NIC, Disk), above that is the firmware (ROM), above that is the OS, then above that is Services (web, Email, and File Servers). Figure 2 shows an example of the virtual architecture abstraction layers. Starting at the bottom and working our way up we have Hardware (CPU, Memory, NIC, Disk), above that is the firmware (ROM), above that is the Hypervisor, above that are three instance of the operating system all on the same level, and finally above that is the Services (Web server, Email server, and File server).
