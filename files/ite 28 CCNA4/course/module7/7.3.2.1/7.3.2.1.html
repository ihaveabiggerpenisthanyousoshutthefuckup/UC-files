        <h1>SDN Controller and Operations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The SDN controller defines the data flows that occur in the SDN Data Plane. A flow is a sequence of packets traversing a network that share a set of header field values. For example, a flow could consist of all packets with the same source and destination IP addresses, or all packets with the same VLAN identifier.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each flow traveling through the network must first get permission from the SDN controller, which verifies that the communication is permissible according to the network policy. If the controller allows a flow, it computes a route for the flow to take and adds an entry for that flow in each of the switches along the path.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All complex functions are performed by the controller. The controller populates flow tables. Switches manage the flow tables. In the figure, an SDN controller communicates with OpenFlow-compatible switches using the OpenFlow protocol. This protocol uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to securely send control plane communications over the network. Each OpenFlow switch connects to other OpenFlow switches. They can also connect to end-user devices that are part of a packet flow.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Within each switch, a series of tables implemented in hardware or firmware are used to manage the flows of packets through the switch. To the switch, a flow is a sequence of packets that matches a specific entry in a flow table. </p>

      <div id="media-description">This figure shows SDN operation. At the center is an OpenFlow switch. Inside the OpenFlow switch are six boxes, three on top and three below. Starting at the bottom, are three boxes, each labeled Flow Table. There is an arrow pointing from the left Flow Table to the center Flow Table and then to the right most Flow Table. The Flow Table matches incoming packets to a particular flow and specifies the functions that are to be performed on the packets. There may be multiple flow tables that operate in a pipeline fashion. The top three boxes depict the Meter Table, Group Table and Secure Channel software. The Meter Table can trigger a variety of performance-related actions on a flow. The Group Table may take a variety of actions triggered by a flow from the Flow Table. The terms Hardware and Firmware are inside the OpenFlow Switch. The OpenFlow switch has a series of arrows connecting it to other devices in the diagram. There are three arrows pointing to three end systems below displayed as host computers. From the OpenFlow switch there is a two-way arrow pointing to the right to two other OpenFlow switches. All three OpenFlow switches have a two-way arrow pointing to an SDN controller depicted by a computer server, communicating using the OpenFlow protocol over SSL.</div>
