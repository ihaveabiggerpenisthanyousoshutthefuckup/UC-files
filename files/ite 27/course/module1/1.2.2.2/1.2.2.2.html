        <h1>Cisco Routers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As the network grows, it is important to select the proper routers to meet its requirements. As shown in the figure, there are three categories of routers:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Branch Routers </b>- Branch routers optimize branch services on a single platform while delivering an optimal application experience across branch and WAN infrastructures. Maximizing service availability at the branch requires networks designed for 24x7x365 uptime. Highly available branch networks must ensure fast recovery from typical faults, while minimizing or eliminating the impact on service, and provide simple network configuration and management.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network Edge Routers</b>
                <b></b>- Network edge routers enable the network edge to deliver high-performance, highly secure, and reliable services that unite campus, data center, and branch networks. Customers expect a high-quality media experience and more types of content than ever before. Customers want interactivity, personalization, mobility, and control for all content. Customers also want to access content anytime and anyplace they choose, over any device, whether at home, at work, or on the go. Network edge routers must deliver enhanced quality of service and nonstop video and mobile capabilities. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Service Provider Routers </b>- Service provider routers differentiate the service portfolio and increase revenues by delivering end-to-end scalable solutions and subscriber-aware services. Operators must optimize operations, reduce expenses, and improve scalability and flexibility, to deliver next-generation Internet experiences across all devices and locations. These systems are designed to simplify and enhance the operation and deployment of service-delivery networks. </li>
            </ul>
