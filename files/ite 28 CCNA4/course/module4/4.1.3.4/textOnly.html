          <p>As shown in Figure 1, the <b>show ip interface</b> command is used to verify the ACL on the interface. The output from this command includes the number or name of the access list and the direction in which the ACL was applied. The output shows router R1 has the access list 1 applied to its S0/0/0 outbound interface and the access list NO_ACCESS applied to its g0/0 interface also in the outbound direction.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example in Figure 2 shows the result of issuing the <b>show access-lists</b> command on router R1. To view an individual access list use the <b>show access-lists</b> command followed by the access list number or name. Notice that the NO_ACCESS statements are out of order and that sequence number 15 is displayed prior to sequence number 10. The reason for this is because Cisco IOS uses a special hashing function for standard ACLs and re-orders host ACEs so they are processed first optimizing the search for a host ACL entry. Standard ACLs process network ACEs in the order in which they were entered.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: The details of the IOS standard ACL hashing function are beyond the scope of this course.</p>
