        <h1>Prioritizing Traffic</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Quality of Service (QoS) is an ever increasing requirement of networks today. New applications available to users, such as voice and live video transmissions, create higher expectations for quality delivery.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Congestion occurs when multiple communication lines aggregate onto a single device such as a router, and then much of that data is placed on fewer outbound interfaces, or onto a slower interface. Congestion can also occur when large data packets prevent smaller packets from being transmitted in a timely manner.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the volume of traffic is greater than what can be transported across the network, devices queue, or hold, the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them. Queuing packets causes delay because new packets cannot be transmitted until previous packets have been processed. If the number of packets to be queued continues to increase, the memory within the device fills up and packets are dropped. One QoS technique that can help with this problem is to classify data into multiple queues, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A device implements QoS only when it is experiencing some type of congestion.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three end devices, a web server, a PC, and an IP phone, they are send packets toward a router. The packets from the IP phone are marked as High Priority, the packets from the PC are marked as Medium Priority, and the packets from the web server are marked as Low Priority. The router mixes the packets from all three queues and sends to the network. An explanation box reads “All communication types have some access to the media. One particular type of traffic cannot take all of the bandwidth.”</div>
