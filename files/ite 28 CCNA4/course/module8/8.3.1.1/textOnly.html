          <p>As the network administrator for a small business, you want to implement a documentation system to use with troubleshooting network-based problems.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After much thought, you decide to compile simple network documentation information into a file to be used when network problems arise. You also know that if the company gets larger in the future, this file can be used to export the information to a computerized, network software system.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To start the network documentation process, you include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A physical diagram of your small business network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A logical diagram of your small business network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Network configuration information for major devices, including routers and switches.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
