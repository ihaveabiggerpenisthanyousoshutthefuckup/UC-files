          <p>A hypervisor is software that creates and runs VM instances. The computer, on which a hypervisor is supporting one or more VMs, is a host machine. Type 2 hypervisors are also called hosted hypervisors. This is because the hypervisor is installed on top of the existing OS, such as Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux. Then, one or more additional OS instances are installed on top of the hypervisor, as shown in the figure.</p>

          <p>A big advantage of Type 2 hypervisors is that management console software is not required.</p>

          <p>Type 2 hypervisors are very popular with consumers and for organizations experimenting with virtualization. Common Type 2 hypervisors include:</p>

          <p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many of these Type 2 hypervisors are free. Some offer more advanced features for a fee.</p>

            <b>Note:</b> It is important to make sure that the host machine is robust enough to install and run the VMs, so that it does not run out of resources.</p>
