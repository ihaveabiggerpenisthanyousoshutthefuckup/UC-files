        <h1>Distance Vector Algorithm</h1>
        <div>
          <p>At the core of the distance vector protocol is the routing algorithm. The algorithm is used to calculate the best paths and then send that information to the neighbors. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The algorithm used for the routing protocols defines the following processes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanism for sending and receiving routing information</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanism for calculating the best paths and installing routes in the routing table</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanism for detecting and reacting to topology changes</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the figure animation, R1 and R2 are configured with the RIP routing protocol. The algorithm sends and receives updates. Both R1 and R2 then glean new information from the update. In this case, each router learns about a new network. The algorithm on each router makes its calculations independently and updates the routing table with the new information. When the LAN on R2 goes down, the algorithm constructs a triggered update and sends it to R1. R1 then removes the network from the routing table.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Different routing protocols use different algorithms to install routes in the routing table, send updates to neighbors, and make path determination decisions. For example:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>RIP uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm as its routing algorithm. It is based on two algorithms developed in 1958 and 1956 by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Jr.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>IGRP and EIGRP use the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) routing algorithm developed by Dr. J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves at SRI International. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure lists the purpose of routing algorithms, which is to send and receive updates, to calculate the best path and install routes in the table, and to detect and react to topology changes.  The figure is an animation that shows two routers sending each other periodic updates, calculating best routers, and maintaining the routing table.  The animation also shows a network failing and the router that it is connected to sending out an update alerting the other router of the failure.</div>
