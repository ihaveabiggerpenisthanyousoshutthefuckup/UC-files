        <h1>Inbound and Outbound ACL Logic</h1>
        <div>

            <b>Inbound ACL Logic</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the logic for an inbound ACL. If the information in a packet header and an ACL statement match, the rest of the statements in the list are skipped, and the packet is permitted or denied as specified by the matched statement. If a packet header does not match an ACL statement, the packet is tested against the next statement in the list. This matching process continues until the end of the list is reached.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the end of every ACL is a statement is an implicit <b>deny any</b> statement. This statement is not shown in output. This final implied statement applied to all packets for which conditions did not test true. This final test condition matches all other packets and results in a "deny" action. Instead of proceeding into or out of an interface, the router drops all of these remaining packets. This final statement is often referred to as the "implicit deny any statement" or the "deny all traffic" statement. Because of this statement, an ACL should have at least one permit statement in it; otherwise, the ACL blocks all traffic.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Outbound ACL Logic</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the logic for an outbound ACL. Before a packet is forwarded to an outbound interface, the router checks the routing table to see if the packet is routable. If the packet is not routable, it is dropped and is not tested against the ACEs. Next, the router checks to see whether the outbound interface is grouped to an ACL. If the outbound interface is not grouped to an ACL, the packet can be sent to the output buffer. Examples of outbound ACL operation are as follows: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>No ACL applied to the interface -</b> If the outbound interface is not grouped to an outbound ACL, the packet is sent directly to the outbound interface. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ACL applied to the interface -</b> If the outbound interface is grouped to an outbound ACL, the packet is not sent out on the outbound interface until it is tested by the combination of ACEs that are associated with that interface. Based on the ACL tests, the packet is permitted or denied.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For outbound lists, "permit" means to send the packet to the output buffer, and "deny" means to discard the packet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one is a flow chart depicting the inbound A.C.L. process. The first box on the left says inbound interface. This feeds into a decision box match 1st a.c.e. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process feeds into the match 2nd A.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process goes to the match 3rd a.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, an implicit deny any is applied and the packet is discarded. At any process step, the process could be a yes on a match for an A.C.E. If the A.C.E statement contains a deny, then the packet is discarded. If the A.C.E. statement contains permit, then the packet is sent to the routing table and destination interface. Figure two is a flow chart depicting the outbound A.C.L. process. A rectangle on the left shows information from the routing table and outbound interface selection going into the first decision of whether the first a.c.e matches. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process feeds into the match 2nd A.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process goes to the match 3rd a.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, an implicit deny any is applied and the packet is discarded. At any process step, the process could be a yes on a match for an A.C.E. If the A.C.E statement contains a deny, then the packet is discarded. If the A.C.E. statement contains permit, then the packet is sent to the outbound interface.</div>
