          <p>GRE is used to create a VPN tunnel between two sites, as shown in Figure 1. To implement a GRE tunnel, the network administrator must first learn the IP addresses of the endpoints. After that, there are five steps to configuring a GRE tunnel:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Create a tunnel interface using the <b>interface tunnel </b><i>number</i><i></i>command.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Configure an IP address for the tunnel interface. This is normally a private IP address.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Specify the tunnel source IP address.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Specify the tunnel destination IP address.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> (Optional) Specify GRE tunnel mode as the tunnel interface mode. GRE tunnel mode is the default tunnel interface mode for Cisco IOS software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The sample configuration in Figure 2 illustrates a basic GRE tunnel configuration for router R1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The configuration of R2 in Figure 3 mirrors the configuration of R1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The minimum configuration requires specification of the tunnel source and destination addresses. The IP subnet must also be configured to provide IP connectivity across the tunnel link. Both tunnel interfaces have the tunnel source set as the local serial S0/0/0 interface and the tunnel destination set as the peer router serial S0/0/0 interface. A private IP address is commonly assigned to the tunnel interface on both routers. OSPF has also been configured to exchange routes over the GRE tunnel.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The individual GRE tunnel command descriptions are displayed in Figure 4.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: When configuring GRE tunnels, it can be difficult to remember which IP networks are associated with the physical interfaces and which IP networks are associated with the tunnel interfaces. Remember that before a GRE tunnel is created, the physical interfaces have already been configured. The <b>tunnel source</b> and <b>tunnel destination</b> commands reference the IP addresses of the preconfigured physical interfaces. The <b>ip address</b> command on the tunnel interfaces refers to an IP network (usually a private IP network) specifically selected for the purposes of the GRE tunnel.</p>
