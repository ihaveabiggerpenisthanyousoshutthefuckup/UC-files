          <p>When a Type 1 hypervisor is installed, and the server is rebooted, only basic information is displayed, such as the OS version, the amount of RAM, and the IP address. An OS instance cannot be created from this screen. Type 1 hypervisors require a “management console” to manage the hypervisor. Management software is used to manage multiple servers using the same hypervisor. The management console can automatically consolidate servers and power on or off servers as required.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, assume that Server1 in the figure becomes low on resources. To make more resources available, the management console moves the Windows instance to the hypervisor on Server2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The management console provides recovery from hardware failure. If a server component fails, the management console automatically and seamlessly moves the VM to another server. The management console for the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) is shown in Figure 2. Cisco UCS Manager provides management for all software and hardware components in the Cisco UCS. It controls multiple servers and manages resources for thousands of VMs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some management consoles also allow over allocation. Over allocation is when multiple OS instances are installed, but their memory allocation exceeds the total amount of memory that a server has. For example, a server has 16 GB of RAM, but the administrator creates four OS instances with 10 GB of RAM allocated to each. This type of over allocation is a common practice because all four OS instances rarely require the full 10 GB of RAM at any one moment.</p>
