          <p>The QoS policy implemented by the network administrator becomes active when congestion occurs on the link. Queuing is a congestion management tool that can buffer, prioritize, and, if required, reorder packets before being transmitted to the destination. A number of queuing algorithms are available. For the purposes of this course, we will focus on the following:</p>
