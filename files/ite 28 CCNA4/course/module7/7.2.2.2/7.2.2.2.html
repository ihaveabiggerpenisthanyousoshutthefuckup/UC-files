        <h1>Dedicated Servers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To fully appreciate virtualization, it is first necessary to understand some of the history of server technology. Historically, enterprise servers consisted of a server operating system (OS), such as Windows Server or Linux Server, installed on specific hardware, as shown in the figure. All of a serverâ€™s RAM, processing power, and hard drive space were dedicated to the service provided (e.g., Web, email services, etc.)</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The major problem with this configuration is that when a component fails, the service that is provided by this server becomes unavailable. This is known as a single point of failure. Another problem was that dedicated servers were underused. Dedicated servers often sat idle for long periods of time, waiting until there was a need to deliver the specific service they provide. These servers wasted energy and took up more space than was warranted by their amount of service. This is known as server sprawl.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure displays historical operating installation with eight servers: a web server, Email server, SQL server, LAN server, DHCP server, Active Directory server, AAA RADIUS server and a Network Management server. The first six servers are Windows servers and the last two are Linux servers.</div>
