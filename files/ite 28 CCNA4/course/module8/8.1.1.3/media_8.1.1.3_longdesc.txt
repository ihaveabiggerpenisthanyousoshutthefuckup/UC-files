Figure shows a cloud. The cloud represents the baseline of a network.  Establishing a baseline helps answer these questions: How does the network perform during a normal or average day? Where are the most errors occurring? Which devices should be monitored and what alert thresholds should be set? Can the network meet the identified policies? What part of the network is most heavily used? What part of the network is least used?
