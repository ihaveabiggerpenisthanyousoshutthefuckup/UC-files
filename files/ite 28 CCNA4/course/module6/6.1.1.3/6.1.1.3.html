        <h1>Bandwidth, Congestion, Delay, and Jitter</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or bits per second (bps). For example, a network device may be described as having the capability to perform at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network congestion causes delay. An interface experiences congestion when it is presented with more traffic than it can handle. Network congestion points are strong candidates for QoS mechanisms. Figure 1 shows three examples of typical congestion points.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Delay or latency refers to the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination. Two types of delays are fixed and variable. A fixed delay is a specific amount of time a specific process takes, such as how long it takes to place a bit on the transmission media. A variable delay take an unspecified amount of time and is affected by factors such as how much traffic is being processed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The sources of delay are summarized in table in Figure 2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Jitter is the variation in the delay of received packets. At the sending side, packets are sent in a continuous stream with the packets spaced evenly apart. Due to network congestion, improper queuing, or configuration errors, the delay between each packet can vary instead of remaining constant. Both delay and jitter need to be controlled and minimized to support real-time and interactive traffic.</p>
