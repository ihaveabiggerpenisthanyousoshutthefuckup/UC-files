          <p>Two types of equipment are required to send signals upstream and downstream on a cable system:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) at the headend of the cable operator</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cable Modem (CM) on the subscriber end</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Click the highlighted components in the figure for more information about how each device contributes to communication.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A headend CMTS communicates with CMs located in subscriber homes. The headend is actually a router with databases for providing Internet services to cable subscribers. The architecture is relatively simple, using an HFC network. The HFC network is a mixed optical-coaxial network in which optical fiber replaces the lower bandwidth coaxial cable. The fiber carries the same broadband content for Internet connections, telephone service, and streaming video as the coaxial cable carries. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a modern HFC network, typically 500 to 2,000 active data subscribers are connected to a cable network segment, all sharing the upstream and downstream bandwidth. Under the new DOCSIS 3.1 standard, this bandwidth can be up to 10 Gb/s downstream and up to 1 Gb/s upstream.</p>
