          <p>The following three policies have been implemented on the network:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hosts from the 2001:DB8:CAFE::/64 network do not have HTTP access to the other networks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hosts from the 2001:DB8:CAFE:1::/64 network are prevented from access to the FTP service on Server2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hosts from the 2001:DB8:CAFE:1::/64 and 2001:DB8:CAFE:2::/64 networks  are prevented from accessing  R1 via SSH.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>No other restrictions should be in place. Unfortunately, the rules that have been implemented are not working correctly. Your task is to find and fix the errors related to the access lists on R1.</p>
