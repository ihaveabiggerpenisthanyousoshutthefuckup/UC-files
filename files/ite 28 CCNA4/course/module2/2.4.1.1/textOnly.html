          <p>The<b> debug </b>command is used for troubleshooting and is accessed from privileged EXEC mode of the command-line interface. A<b> debug </b>output displays information about various router operations, related traffic generated or received by the router, and any error messages. It can consume a significant amount of resources, and the router is forced to process-switch the packets being debugged. The<b> debug </b>command must not be used as a monitoring tool; rather, it is meant to be used for a short period of time for troubleshooting. </p>
