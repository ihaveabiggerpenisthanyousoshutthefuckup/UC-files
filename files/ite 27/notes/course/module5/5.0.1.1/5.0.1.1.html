        <h1>Dynamic Routing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The data networks that we use in our everyday lives to learn, play, and work range from small, local networks to large, global internetworks.  A home network may have a router and two or more computers. At work, an organization may have multiple routers and switches servicing the data communication needs of hundreds, or even thousands, of end devices.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routers forward packets by using information in the routing table. Routes to remote networks can be learned by the router in two ways: static routes and dynamic routes.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a large network with numerous networks and subnets, configuring and maintaining static routes between these networks requires a great deal of administrative and operational overhead. This operational overhead is especially cumbersome when changes to the network occur, such as a failed link or implementing a new subnet. The use of dynamic routing protocols can ease the burden of configuration and maintenance tasks, and give the network infrastructure scalability.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter introduces dynamic routing protocols. It explores the benefits of using dynamic routing protocols, how different routing protocols are classified, and the metrics routing protocols use to determine the best path for network traffic. In addition, the characteristics of dynamic routing protocols, and the differences between the various routing protocols, will be examined. Network professionals must understand the different routing protocols available in order to make informed decisions about when to use static routing, dynamic routing, or both. They also need to know which dynamic routing protocol is most appropriate in a particular network environment.  </p>
