        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Problems that can result from a redundant Layer 2 network include broadcast storms, MAC database instability, and duplicate unicast frames. STP is a Layer 2 protocol that ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>STP sends BPDU frames for communication between switches. One switch is elected as the root bridge for each instance of spanning tree. An administrator can control this election by changing the bridge priority. Root bridges can be configured to enable spanning tree load balancing by VLAN or by a group of VLANs, depending on the spanning tree protocol used. STP then assigns a port role to each participating port using a path cost. The root path cost is equal to the sum of all the port costs along the path to the root bridge. A port cost is automatically assigned to each port; however, it can also be manually configured. Paths with the lowest cost become preferred, and all other redundant paths are blocked.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>PVST+ is the default configuration of IEEE 802.1D on Cisco switches. It runs one instance of STP for each VLAN. A newer, faster-converging spanning tree protocol, RSTP, can be implemented on Cisco switches on a per-VLAN basis in the form of Rapid PVST+. Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) is the Cisco implementation of Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), where one instance of spanning tree runs for a defined group of VLANs.  Features such as PortFast and BPDU guard ensure that hosts in the switched environment are provided immediate access to the network without interfering with spanning tree operation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Switch stacking allows connection of up to nine Catalyst 3750 switches to be configured and presented to the network as a single entity. STP views the switch stack as a single switch. This additional benefit helps ensure the IEEE recommended maximum diameter of seven switches. </p>
