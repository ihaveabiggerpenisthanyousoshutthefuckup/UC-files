Figure 1 shows the traditional architecture shown on the left. It has three device, each with its own control plane and data plane. SDN architecture on the right has three devices with, each with a data plane that is controlled by a centralized SDN controller. Figure 2 show the SDN framework, which consists of the application layer where business applications, cloud orchestration and SDN applications are located. Northbound APIs interface with the next layer, which is the control plane layer. It includes routing, traffic engineering, and mobility. Southbound APIs interface with the next layer, which is the data plane layer, where routers and switches forward traffic
