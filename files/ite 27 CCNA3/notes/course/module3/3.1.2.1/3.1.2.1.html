        <h1>Spanning Tree Algorithm: Introduction</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Redundancy increases the availability of the network topology by protecting the network from a single point of failure, such as a failed network cable or switch. When physical redundancy is introduced into a design, loops and duplicate frames occur. Loops and duplicate frames have severe consequences for a switched network. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was developed to address these issues.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>STP ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop. A port is considered blocked when user data is prevented from entering or leaving that port. This does not include bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) frames that are used by STP to prevent loops. Blocking the redundant paths is critical to preventing loops on the network. The physical paths still exist to provide redundancy, but these paths are disabled to prevent the loops from occurring. If the path is ever needed to compensate for a network cable or switch failure, STP recalculates the paths and unblocks the necessary ports to allow the redundant path to become active.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the <b>Play</b> button in Figure 1 to view STP in action.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example, all switches have STP enabled:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>PC1 sends a broadcast out onto the network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>S2 is configured with STP and has set the port for Trunk2 to a blocking state. The blocking state prevents ports from being used to forward user data, which prevents a loop from occurring. S2 forwards a broadcast frame out all switch ports, except the originating port from PC1 and the port for Trunk2. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>S1 receives the broadcast frame and forwards it out all of its switch ports, where it reaches PC4 and S3. S3 forwards the frame out the port for Trunk2 and S2 drops the frame. The Layer 2 loop is prevented.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the <b>Play</b> in Figure 2 to view STP recalculation when a failure occurs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>STP prevents loops from occurring by configuring a loop-free path through the network using strategically placed "blocking-state" ports. The switches running STP are able to compensate for failures by dynamically unblocking the previously blocked ports and permitting traffic to traverse the alternate paths.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Up to now, we have used the term Spanning Tree Protocol and the acronym STP. The usage of the Spanning Tree Protocol term and the STP acronym can be misleading. Many professionals generically use these to refer to various implementations of spanning tree, such as Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP). In order to communicate spanning tree concepts correctly, it is important to refer to the particular implementation or standard in context. The latest IEEE documentation on spanning tree (IEEE-802-1D-2004) says, "STP has now been superseded by the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)."The IEEE uses "STP" to refer to the original implementation of spanning tree and "RSTP" to describe the version of spanning tree specified in IEEE-802.1D-2004. In this curriculum, when the original Spanning Tree Protocol is the context of a discussion, the phrase “original 802.1D spanning tree” is used to avoid confusion. Since the two protocols share much of the same terminology and methods for the loop-free path, the primary focus will be on the current standard and the Cisco proprietary implementations of STP and RSTP.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: STP is based on an algorithm invented by Radia Perlman while working for Digital Equipment Corporation, and published in the 1985 paper "An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN.”</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one is an animation that shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how S.T.P. prevents a broadcast storm, by placing a port on S.2 into blocking mode thus preventing a loop. Figure two is an animation that shows three switches, s.1, s.2, and s.3.  Each is connected to the other two with a trunk link.  S.2 has P.C.1, P.C.2, and P.C.3 connected.  S.1 has P.C.4 connected.  The animation demonstrates how S.T.P. recovers from an outage by changing the state of the blocked port to forwarding, thus restoring a redundant link and forwarding packets correctly.</div>
