          <p>How can QoS be implemented in a network? The three models for implementing QoS are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Best-effort model</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrated services (IntServ)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Differentiated services (DiffServ)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The table in the figure summarizes these three models. QoS is really implemented in a network using either IntServ or DiffServ. While IntServ provides the highest guarantee of QoS, it is very resource-intensive and therefore, limited in scalability. In contrast, DiffServ is less resource-intensive and more scalable. The two are sometimes co-deployed in network QoS implementations.</p>
