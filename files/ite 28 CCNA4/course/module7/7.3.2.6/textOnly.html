          <p>Each type of SDN has its own features and advantages. Policy-based SDN is the most robust, providing for a simple mechanism to control and manage policies across the entire network. Cisco APIC-EM provides the following features:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Discovery</b> - Supports a discovery functionality that is used to populate the controller's device and host inventory database.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Device Inventory</b> - Collects detailed information from devices within the network including device name, device status, MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, IOS/Firmware, platform, up time, and configuration.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Host Inventory</b> - Collects detailed information from hosts with the network including host name, user ID, MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, and network attachment point.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Topology</b> - Supports a graphical view of the network (topology view). The Cisco APIC-EM automatically discovers and maps devices to a physical topology with detailed device level data. In addition, auto-visualization of Layer 2 and 3 topologies on top of the physical topology provides a granular view for design planning and simplified troubleshooting. The figure shows an example of a topology view generated by the Cisco APIC-EM.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Policy</b> - Ability to view and control policies across the entire network including QoS.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Policy Analysis</b> - Inspection and analysis of network access control policies.  Ability to trace application specific paths between end devices to quickly identify ACLs in use and problem areas. Enables ACL change management with easy identification of redundancy, conflicts and incorrect ordering of access control entries. Incorrect ACL entries are known as shadows.</li>
            </ul>
