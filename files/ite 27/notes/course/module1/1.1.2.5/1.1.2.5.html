            <b>Implementing Wireless Connectivity</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The network must be designed to be able to expand network access to individuals and devices, as needed. An increasingly important aspect of extending access layer connectivity is through wireless connectivity. Providing wireless connectivity offers many advantages, such as increased flexibility, reduced costs, and the ability to grow and adapt to changing network and business requirements. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To communicate wirelessly, end devices require a wireless NIC that incorporates a radio transmitter/receiver and the required software driver to make it operational. Additionally, a wireless router or a wireless access point (AP) is required for users to connect, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are many considerations when implementing a wireless network, such as the types of wireless devices to use, wireless coverage requirements, interference considerations, and security considerations. </p>
