A two column table shows the BGP configuration commands. The two columns are command and description. The first row is the router bgp as-number command which enables a BGP routing process, and places the router in router configuration mode. The second command is neighbor ip-address remote-as as-number which is used to specify a BGP neighbor. The as-number is the neighbor routerâ€™s AS number. The last row contains the network network-address and optionally the mask network-mask command which is used to advertise a network address to an eBGP neighbor as being originated by this AS. The network-mask is the subnet mask of the network.
