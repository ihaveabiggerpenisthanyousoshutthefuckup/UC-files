The Figure shows Company-A AS 65000 connected to ISP-1 AS 65001 cloud through an eBGP connection formed through the G0/1 ports on each edge router on the 209.165.201.0/27 network. The Company-A router uses the .2 IP address and the ISP-1 edge router uses the .1 IP address on the network. AS 65000 Company-A has the 198.133.219.0/24 network. The commands to configure on the Company-A router are as follows: router bgp 65000, neighbor 209.165.201.1 remote-as 65001, network 198.133.219.0 mask 255.255.255.0. Figure 2 shows the configuration that must be done on the ISP-1 router that connects to Company-A: router bgp 65001, neighbor 209.165.201.2 remote-as 65000, and network 0.0.0.0.
