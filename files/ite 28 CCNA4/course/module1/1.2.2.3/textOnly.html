          <p>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a circuit-switching technology that enables the local loop of a PSTN to carry digital signals, resulting in higher capacity switched connections. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ISDN changes the internal connections of the PSTN from carrying analog signals to time-division multiplexed (TDM) digital signals. TDM allows two or more signals, or bit streams, to be transferred as subchannels in one communication channel. The signals appear to transfer simultaneously; but physically, the signals are taking turns on the channel. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays a sample ISDN topology. The ISDN connection may require a terminal adapter (TA) which is a device used to connect ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) connections to a router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two types of ISDN interfaces:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Basic Rate Interface (BRI)</b> - ISDN BRI is intended for the home and small enterprise and provides two 64 kb/s bearer channels (B) for carrying voice and data and a 16 kb/s delta channel (D) for signaling, call setup and other purposes. The BRI D channel is often underused, because it has only two B channels to control (Figure 2). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Primary Rate Interface (PRI)</b> â€“ ISDN is also available for larger installations. In North America, PRI delivers 23 B channels with 64 kb/s and one D channel with 64 kb/s for a total bit rate of up to 1.544 Mb/s. This includes some additional overhead for synchronization. In Europe, Australia, and other parts of the world, ISDN PRI provides 30 B channels and one D channel, for a total bit rate of up to 2.048 Mb/s, including synchronization overhead (Figure 3). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>BRI has a call setup time that is less than a second, and the 64 kb/s B channel provides greater capacity than an analog modem link. If greater capacity is required, a second B channel can be activated to provide a total of 128 kb/s. This permits several simultaneous voice conversations, a voice conversation and data transfer, or a video conference using one channel for voice and the other for video. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another common application of ISDN is to provide additional capacity as needed on a leased line connection. The leased line is sized to carry average traffic loads while ISDN is added during peak demand periods. ISDN is also used as a backup if the leased line fails. ISDN tariffs are based on a per-B channel basis and are similar to those of analog voice connections. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With PRI ISDN, multiple B channels can be connected between two endpoints. This allows for videoconferencing and high-bandwidth data connections with no latency or jitter. However, multiple connections can be very expensive over long distances.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Although ISDN is still an important technology for telephone service provider networks, it has declined in popularity as an Internet connection option with the introduction of high-speed DSL and other broadband services.</p>
