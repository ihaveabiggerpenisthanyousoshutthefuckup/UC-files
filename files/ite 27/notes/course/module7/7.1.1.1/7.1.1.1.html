        <h1>Network Topology</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before fine tuning EIGRP features, start with a basic implementation of EIGRP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the network topology used for this chapter. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the IPv4 interface configurations and the EIGRP implementations on R1, R2, and R3, respectively. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The types of serial interfaces and their associated bandwidths may not necessarily reflect the more common types of connections found in networks today. The bandwidths of the serial links used in this topology help explain the calculation of the routing protocol metrics and the process of best path selection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice that the<b> bandwidth </b>commands on the serial interfaces were used to modify the default bandwidth of 1,544 kb/s.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In this chapter, the ISP router is used as the routing domainâ€™s gateway to the Internet. All three routers are running Cisco IOS, Release 15.2.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the standard lab diagram with the extra link between router one and router three.  Router two is connected to i. s. p. and the internal network is highlighted excluding the link between router two and i. s. p.. Figure two is the output from the "show running dash config" command on router one.  The version of the I.O.S. and the bandwidth for serial zero zero zero are highlighted. Figure three is the output from the "show running dash config" command on router two.  The version of the I.O.S. and the bandwidth for serial zero slash zero slash zero and serial zero slash zero slash one are highlighted. Figure four is the output from the "show running dash config" command on router three.  The version of the I.O.S. and the bandwidth for serial zero zero zero are highlighted.</div>
