The figure shows end-to-end propagation over cable. On the left is the headend with servers and an antenna shown. It is labeled servers (provisioning, cache, web, email). At the edge of the headend is labeled a router that is labeled CMTS. The extra words that go with this device is as follows: A cable modem termination system (CMTS) is a component that exchanges digital signals with cable modems on a cable network. A headend CMTS communicates with CMs that are located in subscriber homes. The CMTS connects to a device labeled fiber. The additional information is as follows: The trunk portion of the cable network is usually fiber optic cable. That device connects to another device labeled Node. The additional information is as follows: Nodes convert optical signals to RF signals. The node connects to a device that also connects to a home in an area called the distribution area and a home that shows inside the home has a device labeled cable modem. The additional information about a distribution area is a follows: A distribution network segment (feeder segment) is from 500 to as many as 2000 subscribers. The additional information about the cable modem is as follows: A cable modem enables you to receive data at high speeds. Typically the cable modem attaches to a standard Ethernet card in the computer.  There is a dashed line that goes from the CMTS to the cable modem. A cable coming out of the distribution area is labeled coaxial cable. This cable leads to a home. Additional information about coaxial cable: Coaxial feeder cables originate from the node and carry RF signals to the subscribers.
