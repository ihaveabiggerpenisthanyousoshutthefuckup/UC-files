The figure shows a topology for generic routing encapsulation. A cloud is shown with a router at each end of the cloud. A LAN connection that sits outside the cloud connects to each router. A pipe connection extends from the router on the left to the router on the right. Above the pipe are the words GRE tunnel (carrier protocol). Below the pipe are the words IP network (transport protocol). 5 rectangles adjacent to one another extend from left to right below the topology figure. The 5 rectangles are labeled from left to right as IP, GRE, IP, TCP, and data. The first two (IP and GRE) are the same color. The remaining 3 rectangles are all the same, but a different color from the first two. The last three rectangles on the right (IP, TCP, and data) are grouped with the heading original IP packet (passenger protocol).
