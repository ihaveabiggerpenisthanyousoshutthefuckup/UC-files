          <p>Without QoS and a significant amount of extra bandwidth capacity, video quality typically degrades. The picture appears blurry, jagged, or in slow motion. The audio portion of the feed may become unsynchronized with the video.</p>

          <p>Video traffic tends to be unpredictable, inconsistent, and bursty compared to voice traffic. Compared to voice, video is less resilient to loss and has a higher volume of data per packet, as shown in Figure 1. Notice how voice packets arrive every 20 ms and are a predictable 200 bytes each. In contrast, the number and size of video packets varies every 33 ms based on the content of the video. For example, if the video stream consists of content that is not changing much from frame to frame, then the video packets will be small and fewer are required to maintain acceptable user experience. However, if the video steam consists of content that is rapidly changing, such as in an action sequence in a movie, then the video packets will be larger and more are required per 33 ms time slot to maintain an acceptable user experience.</p>

          <p>Figure 2 summarizes the characteristics of video traffic. UDP ports, such as 554 used for the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RSTP), should be given priority over other, less time-sensitive, network traffic. Similar to voice, video can tolerate a certain amount of latency, jitter, and loss without any noticeable affects. Latency should be no more than 400 milliseconds (ms). Jitter should be no more than 50 ms, and video packet loss should be no more than 1%. Video traffic requires at least 384 Kbps of bandwidth.</p>
