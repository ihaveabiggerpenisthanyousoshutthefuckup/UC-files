          <p>All private WAN technologies discussed so far used either copper or fiber-optic media. What if an organization needed connectivity in a remote location where there are no service providers that offer WAN service?  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a solution that creates a private WAN using satellite communications. A VSAT is a small satellite dish similar to those used for home Internet and TV. VSATs create a private WAN while providing connectivity to remote locations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Specifically, a router connects to a satellite dish which is pointed to a service providerâ€™s satellite. This satellite is in geosynchronous orbit in space. The signals must travel approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) to the satellite and back. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example in the figure displays a VSAT dish on the roofs of the buildings communicating with a satellite thousands of kilometers away in space. </p>
