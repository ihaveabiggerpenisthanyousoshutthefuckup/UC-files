The lab has an ISP router at the top. The ISP router has a serial interface connection to two other routers, West and East. ISP connects to the Wet router through the S0/0/0 interface on both routers and the west router is the DCE side of the connection. The ISP router connects to the east router through S0/0/1 interfaces on both routers. The ISP S0/0/1 cable is the DCE side. A GRE tunnel is shown between the East and West routers. The West G0/1 interface connects to port F0/5 on switch S1. Port F0/6 on S1 connects to PC-A. The East G0/1 interface connects to port F0/5 on switch S3. Port F0/6 on S1 connects to PC-C. The GRE tunnel and within all LANs on West and East are within OSPF Area 0.
