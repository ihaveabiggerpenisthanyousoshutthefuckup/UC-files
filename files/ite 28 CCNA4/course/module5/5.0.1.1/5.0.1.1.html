        <h1>Chapter 5: Network Security and Monitoring</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A secure network is only as strong as its weakest link and Layer 2 is potentially the weakest link. Common Layer 2 attacks include CDP reconnaissance, Telnet exploitation, MAC address table flooding, VLAN attacks, and DHCP related attacks. Network administrators must know how to mitigate these attacks, and well as securing administrative access using AAA and securing port access using 802.1X.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Monitoring an operational network can provide a network administrator with information to proactively manage the network and to report network usage statistics to others. Link activity, error rates, and link status are a few of the factors that help a network administrator determine the health and usage of a network. Collecting and reviewing this information over time enables a network administrator to see and project growth, and may enable the administrator to detect and replace a failing part before it completely fails. SNMP is commonly used to collect device information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network traffic must be monitored for malicious traffic. Network administrators use port analyzers and IPS devices to help with this task.  However, the switched infrastructure does not enable port mirroring by default. Cisco SPAN must be implemented to enable port mirroring. This enables the switch to send duplicate traffic to port analyzers or IPS devices for monitoring of malicious, or questionable traffic.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter covers common LAN security threats and how to mitigate them. It then covers SNMP and how to enable it to monitor a network, and how to implement local SPAN to capture and monitor traffic with port analyzers or IPS devices.  </p>
