          <p>Broadband transmission is provided by a wide range of technologies, including DSL, fiber-to-the-home, coaxial cable systems, wireless, and satellite. This transmission requires additional components at the home end and at the corporate end. Broadband wireless solutions include municipal Wi-Fi, cellular/mobile, and satellite Internet. Municipal Wi-Fi mesh networks are not widely deployed. Cellular/mobile coverage can be limited and bandwidth can be an issue. Satellite Internet is relatively expensive and limited, but it may be the only method to provide access.</p>

          <p>If multiple broadband connections are available to a particular location, a cost-benefit analysis should be performed to determine the best solution. The best solution may be to connect to multiple service providers to provide redundancy and reliability.</p>

          <p>PPPoE is a popular data link protocol for connecting remote networks to their ISPs. PPPoE provides the flexibility of PPP and the convenience of Ethernet. </p>

          <p>VPNs are used to create a secure end-to-end private network connection over a third party network, such as the Internet. GRE is a basic, non-secure site-to-site VPN tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of protocol packet types inside IP tunnels, thus allowing an organization to deliver other protocols through an IP-based WAN. Today it is primarily used to deliver IP multicast traffic or IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 unicast-only connection.</p>

          <p>BGP is the routing protocol implemented between autonomous systems. Three basic design options for eBGP are as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ISP advertises a default route only to the customer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ISP advertises a default route and all of its routes to the customer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ISP advertises all Internet routes to the customer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Implementing eBGP in a single-homed network only requires a few commands. </p>
