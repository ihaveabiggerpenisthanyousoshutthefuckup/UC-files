        <h1>Common LAN Attacks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Organizations commonly implement security solutions using routers, firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPSs), and VPN devices. These protect the elements in Layer 3 up through Layer 7. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Layer 2 LANs are often considered to be a safe and secure environment. However, as shown in the figure, if Layer 2 is compromised then all layers above it are also affected. Today, with BYOD and more sophisticated attacks, LANs have become more vulnerable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, a disgruntled employee with internal network access could capture Layer 2 frames. This could render all of the security implemented in layers 3 and above useless. The attacker could also wreak havoc on the Layer 2 LAN networking infrastructure and create DoS situations. Therefore, in addition to protecting Layer 3 to Layer 7, network security professionals must also mitigate threats against the Layer 2 LAN infrastructure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first step in mitigating attacks on the Layer 2 infrastructure is to understand the underlying operation of Layer 2 and the threats posed by the Layer 2 infrastructure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Common attacks against the Layer 2 LAN infrastructure include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>CDP Reconnaissance Attack</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Telnet Attacks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>MAC Address Table Flooding Attack</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>VLAN Attacks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>DHCP Attacks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The first two attacks are focused on gaining administrative access to the network device. The remaining attacks are focused on disrupting the network operation. Other more sophisticated attacks exist. However, the focus of this section is on common Layer 2 attacks.</p>
