          <p>LCP functions within the data link layer and has a role in establishing, configuring, and testing the data-link connection. LCP establishes the point-to-point link. LCP also negotiates and sets up control options on the WAN data link, which are handled by the NCPs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>LCP provides automatic configuration of the interfaces at each end:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Handling varying limits on packet size </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Detecting common misconfiguration errors </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Terminating the link </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Determining when a link is functioning properly or when it is failing </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After the link is established, PPP also uses LCP to agree automatically on encapsulation formats such as authentication, compression, and error detection.</p>
