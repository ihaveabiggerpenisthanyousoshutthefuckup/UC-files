            <b>Background/Scenario</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This activity covers the steps to take to discover a network using primarily the<b> telnet</b>,<b> show cdp neighbors detail</b>, and<b> show ip route </b>commands. This is Part I of a two-part activity. Part II is Packet Tracer - Troubleshooting Challenge - Using Documentation to Solve Issues, which comes later in the chapter.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The topology you see when you open the Packet Tracer activity does not reveal all of the details of the network. The details have been hidden using the cluster function of Packet Tracer. The network infrastructure has been collapsed, and the topology in the file shows only the end devices. Your task is to use your knowledge of networking and discovery commands to learn about the full network topology and document it.</p>
