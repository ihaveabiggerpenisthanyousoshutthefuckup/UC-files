Figure 1 shows examining the PPP negotiation process. On the left is a LAN connected to the R1 customer router labeled G0/0. Coming out of the right of R1 via G0/1 is a cable that goes to a modem. G0/1 is labeled .1 and the modem is labeled 10.1.3.0/24. The modem connects to another modem located inside the ISP cloud. The ISP modem connects to router R2 via interface G0/1 that is labeled .2. R2 is also inside the ISP cloud. The following output is shown: R1# debug ppp negotiation, *Sep 20 19:05:05.239: Vi2 PPP: phase is AUTHENTICATING, by the peer, *Sep 20 19:05:05:05.239: Vi2 LCP: (rest of the line is highlighted) state is open, <output omitted>, *Sep 20 19:05:05.247: Vi2 CHAP: using hostname from interface CHAP, *Sep 20 19:05:05.247: Vi2 CHAP: using hostname from interface CHAP, *Sep 20 19:05:05.247: Vi2 CHAP: 0 response id 1 len 26 from “Fred”, *Sep 20 19:05:05.255: Vi2 (rest of the line is highlighted) CHAP: I SUCCESS id 1 len 4, (rest of the line is highlighted), *Sep 20 19:05:05.259: Vi2 IPCP: address 10.1.3.2 (0x0306a010302), *Sep 20 19:05:05.259: Vi2 IPCP: event [receive confack] state[acksent to open], *Sep 20 19:05:05.271: Vi2 (rest of line is highlighted): IPCP: State is open. *Sep 20 19:05:05.271: Di2 (rest of line is highlighted) IPCP: Install negotiated IP interface address 10.1.3.2. *Sep 20 19:05:05.271: Di2 Added to neighbor route AVL tree: topoid 0, address 10.1.3.2. *Sep 20 19:05:05.271: Di2 IPCP: (rest of line is highlighted) Install route to 10.1.3.2.
