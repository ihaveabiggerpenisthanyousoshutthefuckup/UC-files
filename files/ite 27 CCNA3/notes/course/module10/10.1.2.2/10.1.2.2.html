        <h1>Verifying the Propagated IPv4 Default Route</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Verify the default route settings on R2 using the<b> show ip route </b>command, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to verify that the default route has been propagated to R1 and R3. Notice that the route source is<b> O*E2</b>, signifying that it was learned using OSPFv2. The asterisk identifies this as a good candidate for the default route. The E2 designation identifies that it is an external route. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>External routes are either external type 1 or external type 2. The difference between the two is in the way the cost (metric) of the route is being calculated. The cost of a type 2 route is always the external cost, regardless of the interior cost to reach that route. A type 1 cost is the addition of the external cost and the internal cost used to reach that route. A type 1 route is always preferred over a type 2 route for the same destination.</p>

Figure two is an interactive activity that allows the learner to practice listing the routing table for router two and router three in order to verify that the default static route is configured and propagates to router three correctly.</div>
