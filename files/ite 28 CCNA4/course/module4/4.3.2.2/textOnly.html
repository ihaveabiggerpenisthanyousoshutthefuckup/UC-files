          <p>In IPv6 there are only named ACLs. The configuration is similar to that of an IPv4 extended named ACL. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the command syntax for IPv6 ACLs. The syntax is similar to the syntax used for an IPv4 extended ACL. One significant difference is the use of the IPv6 prefix-length instead of an IPv4 wildcard mask.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are three basic steps to configure an IPv6 ACL:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>From global configuration mode, use the <b>ipv6 access-list </b><i>name </i>command to create an IPv6 ACL. Like IPv4 named ACLs, IPv6 names are alphanumeric, case sensitive, and must be unique. Unlike IPv4, there is no need for a standard or extended option. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>From the named ACL configuration mode, use the <b>permit</b> or <b>deny</b> statements to specify one or more conditions to determine if a packet is forwarded or dropped. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Return to privileged EXEC mode with the <b>end</b> command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 demonstrates the steps to create an IPv6 ACL with a simple example based on the previous topology. The first statement names the IPv6 access list NO-R3-LAN-ACCESS. Similar to IPv4 named ACLs, capitalizing IPv6 ACL names is not required, but makes them stand out when viewing the running-config output.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The second statement denies all IPv6 packets from the 2001:DB8:CAFE:30::/64 destined for any IPv6 network. The third statement allows all other IPv6 packets.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows the ACL in context with the topology.</p>
