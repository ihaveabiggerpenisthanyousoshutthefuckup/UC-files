        <h1>Chapter 2: Point-to-Point Connections</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One of the most common types of WAN connections, especially in long-distance communications, is a point-to-point connection, also called a serial or leased-line connection. Because these connections are typically provided by a carrier, such as a telephone company, boundaries between what is managed by the carrier and what is managed by the customer must be clearly established.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This chapter covers the terms, technology, and protocols used in serial connections. The HDLC and Point-to-Point Protocols (PPP) are introduced. HDLC is the default protocol on a Cisco router serial interface. PPP is a protocol that is able to handle authentication, compression, error detection, monitor link quality, and logically bundle multiple serial connections together to share the load.  </p>
