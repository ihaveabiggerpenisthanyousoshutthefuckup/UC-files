        <h1>OSPF LSA Type 3</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Type 3 LSAs are used by ABRs to advertise networks from other areas. ABRs collect type 1 LSAs in the LSDB. After an OSPF area has converged, the ABR creates a type 3 LSA for each of its learned OSPF networks. Therefore, an ABR with many OSPF routes must create type 3 LSAs for each network.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, ABR1 and ABR2 floods type 3 LSAs from one area to other areas. ABR1 propagates the Area 1 information into Area 0 using Type 3 LSAs. ABR1 also propagates the Area 0 information into Area 1 using Type 3 LSAs. ABR2 does the same thing for Area 2 and Area 0. In a large OSPF deployment with many networks, propagating type 3 LSAs can cause significant flooding problems. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that manual route summarization be configured on the ABR.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The link-state ID is set to the network number and the mask is also advertised.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Receiving a type 3 LSA into an area does not cause a router to run the SPF algorithm. The routes being advertised in the type 3 LSAs are appropriately added to or deleted from the routerâ€™s routing table, but a full SPF calculation is not necessary.</p>
