        <h1>Advantages of Virtualization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One major advantage of virtualization is overall reduced cost:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Less equipment is required</b> - Virtualization enables server consolidation, which requires fewer physical servers, fewer networking devices, and less supporting infrastructure. It also means lower maintenance costs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Less energy is consumed</b> - Consolidating servers lowers the monthly power and cooling costs. Reduced consumption helps enterprises to achieve a smaller carbon footprint.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Less space is required</b> - Server consolidation with virtualization reduces the overall footprint of the data center. Fewer servers, network devices, and racks reduce the amount of required floor space.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are additional benefits of virtualization:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Easier prototyping</b> - Self-contained labs, operating on isolated networks, can be rapidly created for testing and prototyping network deployments. If a mistake is made, an administrator can simply revert to a previous version. The testing environments can be online, but isolated from end users. When testing is completed, the servers and systems can be deployed to end users.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Faster server provisioning</b> - Creating a virtual server is far faster than provisioning a physical server.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Increased server uptime</b> - Most server virtualization platforms now offer advanced redundant fault tolerance features, such as live migration, storage migration, high availability, and distributed resource scheduling. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Improved disaster recovery</b> - Virtualization offers advanced business continuity solutions. It provides hardware abstraction capability so that the recovery site no longer needs to have hardware that is identical to the hardware in the production environment. Most enterprise server virtualization platforms also have software that can help test and automate the failover before a disaster does happen.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Legacy Support</b> - Virtualization can extend the life of OSs and applications providing more time for organizations to migrate to newer solutions.</li>
            </ul>
