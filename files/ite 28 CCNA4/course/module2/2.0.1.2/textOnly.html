            <b>PPP Persuasion</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Your network engineering supervisor recently attended a networking conference where Layer 2 protocols were discussed. He knows that you have Cisco equipment on the premises, but he would also like to offer security and advanced TCP/IP options and controls on that same equipment by using the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After researching the PPP protocol, you find it offers some advantages over the HDLC protocol, currently used on your network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Create a matrix listing the advantages and disadvantages of using the HDLC vs. PPP protocols. When comparing the two protocols, include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ease of configuration</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adaptability to non-proprietary network equipment</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Security options</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bandwidth usage and compression</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bandwidth consolidation</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Share your chart with another student or class. Justify whether or not you would suggest sharing the matrix with the network engineering supervisor to justify a change being made from HDLC to PPP for Layer 2 network connectivity.</p>
