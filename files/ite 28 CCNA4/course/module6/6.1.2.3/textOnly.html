          <p>Voice traffic is predictable and smooth, as shown in the figure. However, voice is very sensitive to delays and dropped packets; there is no reason to re-transmit voice if packets are lost. Therefore, voice packets must receive a higher priority than other types of traffic. For example, Cisco products use the RTP port range 16384 to 32767 to prioritize voice traffic. Voice can tolerate a certain amount of latency, jitter, and loss without any noticeable effects. Latency should be no more than 150 milliseconds (ms). Jitter should be no more than 30 ms, and voice packet loss should be no more than 1%. Voice traffic requires at least 30 Kbps of bandwidth.</p>
