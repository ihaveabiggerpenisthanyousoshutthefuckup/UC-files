          <p>One of the most important features of the APIC-EM controller is the ability to manage policies across the entire network. Policies operate at a higher level of abstraction. Traditional device configuration applies to one device at a time, whereas SDN policies apply to the entire network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>APIC-EM ACL Analysis and Path Trace provide tools to allow the administrator to analyze and understand ACL policies and configurations.  Creating new ACLs or editing existing ACLs across a network to implement a new security policy can be challenging. Administrators are hesitant of changing ACLs for fear of breaking them and causing new problems. ACL Analysis and Path Trace allows the administrator to easily visualize traffic flows and discover any conflicting, duplicate, or shadowed ACL entries.</p>

          <p>APIC-EM provides the following tools to troubleshoot ACL entries:</p>
          <p></p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ACL Analysis </b>- This tool examines ACLs on devices, searching for redundant, conflicting, or shadowed entries. ACL Analysis enables ACL inspection and interrogation across the entire network, exposing any problems and conflicts. An example screenshot of this tool is shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ACL Path Trace </b>- This tool examines specific ACLs on the path between two end nodes, displaying any potential issues. An example screenshot of this tool is shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
