        <h1>PPPoE Verification</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, the customer’s router is connected to the ISP router using DSL. Both routers have been configured for PPPoE. The <b>show ip interface brief</b> command is issued on R1 to verify the IPv4 address automatically assigned to the dialer interface by the ISP router.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 2, the <b>show interface dialer</b> command on R1, verifies the MTU and PPP encapsulation configured on the dialer interface.</p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the routing table on R1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice that two /32 host routes for 10.0.0.0 have been installed in R1’s routing table. The first host route is for the address assigned to the dialer interface. The second host route is the IPv4 address of the ISP. The installation of these two host routes is the default behavior for PPPoE.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 4, the <b>show pppoe session</b> command is used to display information about currently active PPPoE sessions. The output displays the local and remote Ethernet MAC addresses of both routers. The Ethernet MAC addresses can be verified by using the <b>show interfaces</b> command on each router.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows to verify the dialer interface is up. On the left is a LAN connected to the R1 customer router labeled G0/0. Coming out of the right of R1 via G0/1 is a cable that goes to a modem. G0/1 is labeled .1 and the modem is labeled 10.1.3.0/24. The modem connects to another modem located inside the ISP cloud. The ISP modem connects to router R2 via interface G0/1 that is labeled .2. R2 is also inside the ISP cloud. The following output is shown: R1# show ip interface brief. The output is in 6 columns labeled interface, IP-address, OK? Method, status, and protocol. The first line is as follows: Embeeded-service-engine0/0, unassigned, yes, unset, administratively down, down. The second line is gigabitEthernet0/0, unassigned, yes, unset, administratively down, down. The third line is gigabitEthernet0/1, unassigned, yes, unset, up, up. The fourth line is serial0/0/0, unassigned, yes, unset, administratively down, down. The fifth line is serial0/0/1, unassigned, yes, unset, administratively down, down. The sixth line is highlighted and shows dialer2, 10.1.3.1, yes, IPCP, up, up. The seventh line is virtual-access1, unassigned, yes, unset, up, up. The eighth line is virtual-access2, unassigned, yes, unset, up, up. Figure 2 shows the same topology as Figure 1 and says to verify the MTU size and encapsulation. Below the topology is the following command output: R1# show interface dialer 2, dialer2 is up, line protocol is up (spoofing), hardware is unknown, Internet address is 10.1.3.1/32, MTU1492 bytes, (which is highlighted) BW 56 Kbit/sec, dly 20000 usec, reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255, encapsulation ppp (which is highlighted), lcp closed, loopback not set, keepablive set (10 sec) dtr is pulsed for 1 seconds on reset, <output omitted>. Figure 3 is the same topology to verify the R1 routing table and has the following command output: R1# show ip route, <output omitted>, gateway of last resort is 0.0.0.0 to network 0.0.0.0, S8 0.0.0.0/0 is directly connected, dialer2, 10.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets. The following line is highlighted: C 10.1.3.1 is directly connected, dialer2. The following line is highlighted: C 10.1.3.2 is directly connected, dialer2. R1#. Figure 4 has the same topology as Figures 1 through 3 and focuses on how to view current PPPoE sessions. The following output is shown: R1# show pppoe session, 1 client session. Uniq ID, PPPoE, RemMAC (highlighted), port, VT, VA, state, SID, LocMAC (highlighted), VA-st, type, N/A, 1 30f7.0da3.1641 (highlighted) Gi0/1, Di2, Vi2, up, 30f7.0da3.0da1 (highlighted), up, R1#.</div>
