          <p>PPP originally emerged as an encapsulation protocol for transporting IPv4 traffic over point-to-point links. PPP provides a standard method for transporting multiprotocol packets over point-to-point links.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are many advantages to using PPP, including the fact that it is not proprietary. PPP includes many features not available in HDLC:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The link quality management feature (LQM) monitors the quality of the link. LQM can be configured with the interface command<b> ppp quality </b><i>percentage</i>. If the error percentage falls below the configured threshold, the link is taken down and packets are rerouted or dropped.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>PPP supports PAP and CHAP authentication. This feature is explained and practiced in a later section.</li>
            </ul>
