        <h1>When to use BGP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The use of BGP is most appropriate when an AS has connections to multiple autonomous systems. This is known as multi-homed.  Each AS in the figure is multi-homed because each AS has connections to at least two other autonomous systems or BGP peers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before running BGP, it is important that the network administrator has a good understanding of BGP. A misconfiguration of a BGP router could have negative effects throughout the entire Internet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">To show multi-homed connections, 5 clouds are shown. Each cloud connects to two or more other clouds. The cloud labeled AS 65001 there is one router that is on the edge of the cloud that connects to a router on the edge of a cloud labeled AS 65002 and a router on the edge of a cloud labeled AS 65004. The routers that connect between two AS’s have an arrow between the clouds pointing toward each cloud and has the word BGP. Inside As 65001 are several routers and the words ISP-1 (EIGRP). The cloud labeled AS 65002 Company (OSPF) has two edge routers—the one that connects to AS65001 as already mentioned and a router that is on the edge of the cloud labeled AS 65003 ISP-3 (EIGRP). The router on the edge of the cloud labeled AS65003 also connects to a router on the edge of AS 65004 and a router on the edge of AS 65005. The cloud labeled AS 65004 has two routers on the edge of the cloud. One router connects to a router on the edge of AS 65001 as already mentioned and the other router connects to the router on the edge of AS 65005. There are several other routers in the cloud labeled AS o65004 ISP-2 (OSPF). The AS 65005 cloud only has one edge router that connects to the edge router in AS 65003 and one of the edge routers in AS 65004. The AS 65005 cloud is labeled Content Provider (OSPF) and contains several other routers.</div>
