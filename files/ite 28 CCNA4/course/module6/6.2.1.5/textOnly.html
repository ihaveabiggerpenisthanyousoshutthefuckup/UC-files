          <p>The differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing QoS guarantees on modern IP networks. For example, DiffServ can provide low-latency guaranteed service to critical network traffic such as voice or video while providing simple best-effort traffic guarantees to non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The DiffServ design overcomes the limitations of both the best-effort and IntServ models. The DiffServ model is described in RFCs 2474, 2597, 2598, 3246, 4594. DiffServ can provide an “almost guaranteed” QoS while still being cost-effective and scalable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The DiffServ model is similar in concept to sending a package using a delivery service. You request (and pay for) a level of service when you send a package. Throughout the package network, the level of service you paid for is recognized and your package is given either preferential or normal service, depending on what you requested.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>DiffServ is not an end-to-end QoS strategy because it cannot enforce end-to-end guarantees. However, DiffServ QoS is a more scalable approach to implementing QoS. Unlike IntServ and hard QoS in which the end-hosts signal their QoS needs to the network, DiffServ does not use signaling. Instead, DiffServ uses a “soft QoS” approach.  It works on the provisioned-QoS model, where network elements are set up to service multiple classes of traffic each with varying QoS requirements.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 is a simple illustration of the DiffServ model.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As a host forwards traffic to a router, the router classifies the flows into aggregates (classes) and provides the appropriate QoS policy for the classes. DiffServ enforces and applies QoS mechanisms on a hop-by-hop basis, uniformly applying global meaning to each traffic class to provide both flexibility and scalability. For example, DiffServ could be configured to group all TCP flows as a single class, and allocate bandwidth for that class, rather than for the individual flows as IntServ would do. In addition to classifying traffic, DiffServ minimizes signaling and state maintenance requirements on each network node.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Specifically, DiffServ divides network traffic into classes based on business requirements. Each of the classes can then be assigned a different level of service. As the packets traverse a network, each of the network devices identifies the packet class and services the packet according to that class. It is possible to choose many levels of service with DiffServ. For example, voice traffic from IP phones is usually given preferential treatment over all other application traffic, email is generally given best-effort service, and nonbusiness traffic can either be given very poor service or blocked entirely.</p>

            <b>Note</b>: Modern networks primarily use the DiffServ model. However, due to the increasing volumes of delay- and jitter-sensitive traffic, IntServ and RSVP are sometimes co-deployed.</p>
