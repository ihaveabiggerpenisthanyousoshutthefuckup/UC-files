        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div>
          <p>EtherChannel aggregates multiple switched links together to load balance over redundant paths between two devices. All ports in one EtherChannel must have the same speed, duplex setting, and VLAN information on all interfaces on the devices at both ends. Settings configured in the port channel interface configuration mode will also be applied to the individual interfaces in that EtherChannel. Settings configured on individual interfaces will not be applied to the EtherChannel or to the other interfaces in the EtherChannel.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>PAgP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that aids in the automatic creation of EtherChannel links. PAgP modes are on, PAgP desirable, and PAgP auto. LACP is part of an IEEE specification that also allows multiple physical ports to be bundled into one logical channel. The LACP modes are on, LACP active and LACP passive. PAgP and LACP do not interoperate. The on mode is repeated in both PAgP and LACP because it creates an EtherChannel unconditionally, without the use of PAgP or LACP. The default for EtherChannel is that no mode is configured.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>First Hop Redundancy Protocols, such as HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP provide alternate default gateways for hosts in the redundant router or multilayer switched environment. Multiple routers share a virtual IP address and MAC address that is used as the default gateway on a client. This ensures that hosts maintain connectivity in the event of the failure of one device serving as a default gateway for a VLAN or set of VLANs. When using HSRP or VRRP, one router is active or forwarding for a particular group while others are in standby mode. GLBP allows the simultaneous use of multiple gateways in addition to providing automatic failover.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two topologies. Each topology has two switches with a connection between the switches on two ports.  In the first topology, the connected ports on each switch are running at one gigabit per second, are in full duplex mode, and are placed in V LAN ten.  This configuration allows the formation of an ether channel.  In the second topology, the ports on each switch are running at one gigabit per second and are placed in V LAN ten. However, one port is running in half duplex mode, while the port on the other switch is running in full duplex.  This configuration will not allow the formation of an ether channel.</div>
