        <h1>Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Very few organizations actually have the desire or skill to program the network using SDN tools. However, the majority of organizations want to automate the network, accelerate application deployments, and align their IT infrastructures to better meet business requirements. Cisco developed the Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) to meet these objectives in more advanced and innovative ways than earlier SDN approaches.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ACI is a data center network architecture that was developed by Insieme and acquired by Cisco in 2013. Cisco ACI is a purpose-built hardware solution for integrating cloud computing and data center management. At a high level, the policy element of the network is removed from the data plane. This simplifies the way data center networks are created.</p>
