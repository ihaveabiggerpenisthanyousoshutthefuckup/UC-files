Figure is a flow chart depicting how a standard A.C.L. works. An incoming packet enters a router and a decision to be made is if there is a standard access list on this interface. If no, the decision is then to determine if the destination IP address in the routing table. The results of this decision is discussed later. If there is a standard A.C.L. on the interface, the decision is to determine if the source address matches an A.C.L. list entry. If no, then the decision is if this was the last entry in the A.C.L. If yes, the packet is trashed and a destination not found message is sent. If no, you move to the next statement to proceed through the A.C.L. list entries. If the source address does match an A.C. L. list entry, then determine if that entry is a permit or deny condition. If it is a deny condition trash the packet and the router sends a destination not found message. If the entry is a permit, the decision must be made to determine if the destination IP address is in the routing table. If no, then trash the packet and a destination not found message is sent. If the destination IP address is in the routing table, the packet is sent to the outgoing interface.
