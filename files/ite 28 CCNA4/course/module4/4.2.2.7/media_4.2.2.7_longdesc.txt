Figures one, two, and three are interactive media elements that allow the learner to create extended A.C.L.s. Figure 1 topology has the 10.1.3.0/24 LAN connected to Fa0/0 on R1. There is a server with the I.P. address of 10.1.3.8. S0/0/0 on R1 connects to S0/0/0 on R2. R2 has two LANs. The 10.1.1.0/24 LAN connects to Fa0/0 on R2. The 10.1.2.0/24 LAN connects to Fa0/1 on R2. A note that the ACL will be applied here points to the Fa0/0 interface on R2. The instructions are as follows: Extended A.C.L. scenario 1 – create an extended A.C.L. based on the requirements and the topology shown. Drag the A.C.L. statement components to the fields so that, when read from left to right, you have created a valid A.C.L. for the scenario. Some components will not be used. Create a numbered A.C.L. statement that will only allow users on the 10.1.1.0/24 to have H.T.T.P. access to the web server on the 10.1.3.0/24 network. The A.C.L. is applied to R2 Fa0/0 inbound. There is a horizontal line of 8 empty boxes. The A.C.L. statement components are as follows: 99, 10.1.3.0, 0.0.0.0, 10.1.2.0, permit, u.d.p. 0.0.0.255, e.q. 21, any, i.p., deny, access-list, 10.1.3.8, 10.1.1.0, e.q. 80, 101, host, and tcp. Figure 2 has the same topology; however, the note is pointing toward the Fa0/1 interface of R2 and reads A.C.L. will be applied here. The instructions are as follows: Extended A.C.L. Scenario 2 – Create an extended A.C.L. based on the requirements and the topology shown. Drag the A.C.L. statement components to the fields so that, when read from left to right you have created a valid A.C.L. for the scenario. Some components will not be used. Create a numbered A.C.L. statement that will block host 10.1.2.9 from having F.T.P. access to the 10.1.1.0/24 network. The A.C.L. is applied to R2 Fa0/1 inbound. There is a row of 9 empty rectangles. The ACL statement components are as follows: u.d.p., 88, any, e.q. 80, 10.1.2.9, permit, host, e.q. 21, i.p., 122, 0.0.0.255, access-list, 10.1.2.0, 10.1.1.0, t.c.p., 0.0.0.0, e.q. 53, and deny. Figure 3 has the same topology as before except that the note is pointing to the Fa0/0 interface of R1 and says A.C.L. will be applied here. Instructions Extended A.C.L. Scenario 3 – Create an extended A.C.L. based on the requirements and the topology shown. Drag the A.C.L. statement components to the fields so that, when read from left to right, you have created a valid A.C.L. for the scenario. Some components will not be used. Create a numbered A.C.L. statement that will allow only host 10.1.3.8 on the 10.1.3.0/24network to reach destinations beyond that network. The A.C.L. is applied to R1 Fa0/0 inbound. There are 7 blank rectangles. The A.C.L. statement components are as follows: t.c.p., i.p. 150, host, 10.1.3.8, e.q. 80, 10.1.3.0, access-list, 10.1.2.0, 50, deny, any, u.d.p., 10.1.1.0, permit 0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.255, and e.q. 21.
