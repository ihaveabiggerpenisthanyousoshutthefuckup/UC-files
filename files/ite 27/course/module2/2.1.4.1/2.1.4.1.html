        <h1>Introduction to DTP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Ethernet trunk interfaces support different trunking modes. An interface can be set to trunking or nontrunking, or to negotiate trunking with the neighbor interface. Trunk negotiation is managed by the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), which operates on a point-to-point basis only, between network devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that is automatically enabled on Catalyst 2960 and Catalyst 3560 Series switches. Switches from other vendors do not support DTP. DTP manages trunk negotiation only if the port on the neighbor switch is configured in a trunk mode that supports DTP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Caution</b>: Some internetworking devices might forward DTP frames improperly, which can cause misconfigurations. To avoid this, turn off DTP on interfaces on a Cisco switch connected to devices that do not support DTP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The default DTP configuration for Cisco Catalyst 2960 and 3560 switches is dynamic auto as shown in Figure 1 on interface F0/3 of switches S1 and S3. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To enable trunking from a Cisco switch to a device that does not support DTP, use the<b> switchport mode trunk </b>and<b> switchport nonegotiate </b>interface configuration mode commands. This causes the interface to become a trunk, but not generate DTP frames.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, the link between switches S1 and S2 becomes a trunk because the F0/1 ports on switches S1 and S2 are configured to ignore all DTP advertisements, and to come up in and stay in trunk port mode. The F0/3 ports on switches S1 and S3 are set to dynamic auto, so the negotiation results in the access mode state. This creates an inactive trunk link. When configuring a port to be in trunk mode, use the<b> switchport mode trunk </b>command. Then there is no ambiguity about which state the trunk is in; it is always on.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows switch one connected to switches two and three with trunk links.  There are callouts pointing to each of the switchports stating the mode they are configured as.  The two ports for the link between switches one and two are configured as trunk ports.  The ports for the link between switches one and three are configured as dynamic auto ports. Figure two shows the same lan. The link between switches one and two will form a trunk since both ports are set to trunk.  The link between switches one and three will not form a trunk since they are both set to dynamic auto.</div>
