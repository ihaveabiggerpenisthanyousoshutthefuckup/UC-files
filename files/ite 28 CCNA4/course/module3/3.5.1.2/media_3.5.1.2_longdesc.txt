The figure has three clouds labeled AS65001, AS65002, and other ISP. Each cloud connects to the two other clouds with a bidirectional arrow shown labeled eBGP. The cloud labeled AS65001 has 4 routers, the router that connects to AS65002 and that connects to another router inside the same cloud. That router connects to another internal router, which in turn, connects to another internal router that is on the edge of the AS65001 cloud. This edge router connects to another cloud labeled Other ISP. The Other ISP cloud shows to overlap another cloud labeled ISP.  In summary, routers inside an AS cloud connect through iBGP. Between AS clouds or between an AS cloud and another ISP cloud, an eBGP connection is used.
