          <p>As noted at the beginning of this chapter, security is only as strong as the weakest link in the system, and Layer 2 is considered to be that weakest link. Therefore, Layer 2 security solutions must be implemented to help secure a network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many network management protocols including Telnet, Syslog, SNMP, TFTP, and FTP are insecure. There are several strategies to help secure Layer 2 of a network:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Always use secure variants of these protocols such as SSH, SCP, SSL, SNMPv3, and SFTP.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Always use strong passwords and change them often.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enable CDP on select ports only.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Secure Telnet access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a dedicated management VLAN where nothing but management traffic resides.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use ACLs to filter unwanted access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure highlights four Cisco switch security solutions to help mitigate Layer 2 attacks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This topic covers several Layer 2 security solutions:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mitigating MAC address table flooding attacks using port security</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mitigating VLAN attacks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mitigating DHCP attacks using DHCP snooping</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Securing administrative access using AAA </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Securing device access using 802.1X port authentication</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>

            <b>Note</b>: IP Source Guard (IPSG) and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) are advanced switch security solutions discussed in the CCNA Security course. </p>
