        <h1>Network Virtualization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Server virtualization hides server resources (for example, the number and identity of physical servers, processors, and OSs) from server users. This practice can create problems if the data center is using traditional network architectures.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, Virtual LANs (VLANs) used by VMs must be assigned to the same switch port as the physical server running the hypervisor. However, VMs are movable, and the network administrator must be able to add, drop, and change network resources and profiles. This process is difficult to do with traditional network switches.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another problem is that traffic flows differ substantially from the traditional client-server model. Typically, a data center has a considerable amount of traffic being exchanged between virtual servers (referred to as East-West traffic). These flows change in location and intensity over time, requiring a flexible approach to network resource management.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Existing network infrastructures can respond to changing requirements related to the management of traffic flows by using Quality of Service (QoS) and security level configurations for individual flows. However, in large enterprises using multivendor equipment, each time a new VM is enabled, the necessary reconfiguration can be very time-consuming.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Could the network infrastructure also benefit from virtualization? If so, then how?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The answer is found in how a networking device operates using a data plane and a control plane, as discussed later in the chapter.</p>
