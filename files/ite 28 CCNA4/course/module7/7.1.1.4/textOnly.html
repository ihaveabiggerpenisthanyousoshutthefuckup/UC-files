          <p>The challenge for IoT is to securely integrate millions of new things from multiple vendors into existing networks. To help address these challenges, Cisco introduced the Cisco IoT System to help organizations and industries adopt IoT solutions. Specifically, the Cisco IoT System reduces the complexities of digitization for manufacturing, utilities, oil and gas, transportation, mining, and public sector organizations.</p>

          <p>The IoT system provides an infrastructure designed to manage large scale systems of very different endpoints and platforms, and the huge amount of data that they create. The Cisco IoT System uses a set of new and existing products and technologies to help reduce the complexity of digitization.</p>
