          <p>A layered architecture is a logical model, design, or blueprint that aids in communication between interconnecting layers. The figure maps the layered architecture of PPP against the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. PPP and OSI share the same physical layer, but PPP distributes the functions of LCP and NCP differently. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the physical layer, you can configure PPP on a range of interfaces. The only absolute requirement imposed by PPP is a full-duplex circuit, either dedicated or switched, that can operate in an asynchronous or synchronous bit-serial mode. The physical layer standards are transparent to PPP link layer frames. PPP does not impose any restrictions regarding transmission rate. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most of the work done by PPP happens at the data link and network layers, by LCP and NCPs. </p>
