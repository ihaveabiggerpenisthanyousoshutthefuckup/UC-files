        <h1>OSPF DR and BDR</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Why is a DR and BDR election necessary?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Multiaccess networks can create two challenges for OSPF regarding the flooding of LSAs:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Creation of multiple adjacencies </b>- Ethernet networks could potentially interconnect many OSPF routers over a common link. Creating adjacencies with every router is unnecessary and undesirable. It would lead to an excessive number of LSAs exchanged between routers on the same network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Extensive flooding of LSAs </b>- Link-state routers flood their LSAs any time OSPF is initialized, or when there is a change in the topology. This flooding can become excessive.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To understand the problem with multiple adjacencies, we must study a formula:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For any number of routers (designated as <i>n</i>) on a multiaccess network, there are <i>n</i> (<i>n</i> – 1) / 2 adjacencies. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows a simple topology of five routers, all of which are attached to the same multiaccess Ethernet network. Without some type of mechanism to reduce the number of adjacencies, collectively these routers would form 10 adjacencies: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>5 (5 – 1) / 2 = 10 </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This may not seem like much, but as routers are added to the network, the number of adjacencies increases dramatically, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To understand the problem of extensive flooding of LSAs, play the animation in Figure 3. In the animation, R2 sends out an LSA. This event triggers every other router to also send out an LSA. Not shown in the animation are the required acknowledgments sent for every LSA received. If every router in a multiaccess network had to flood and acknowledge all received LSAs to all other routers on that same multiaccess network, the network traffic would become quite chaotic.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The solution to managing the number of adjacencies and the flooding of LSAs on a multiaccess network is the DR. On multiaccess networks, OSPF elects a DR to be the collection and distribution point for LSAs sent and received. A BDR is also elected in case the DR fails. All other routers become DROTHERs. A DROTHER is a router that is neither the DR nor the BDR.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The DR is only used for the dissemination of LSAs. The router will still use the best next-hop router indicated in the routing table for the forwarding of all other packets.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Play the animation in Figure 4 to see the role of DR.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows five routers. All five are connected to a central switch. No router is directly connected to another router.  The figure is demonstrating a multiaccess network that would require the formation of 10 adjacencies. Figure two is a chart that demonstrates how an increase in routers causes a drastic increase in adjacencies.  For example 5 routers will require 10 adjacencies, 20 routers will require 190 adjacencies, and 100 routers will require 4,950 adjacencies. Figure three shows five routers. All three are connected to a central switch. No router is directly connected to another router.  Figure is an animation that shows one of the routers sending out a link state advertisement to each of the other routers that it formed an adjacency with.  As each of these four routers receives the L.S.A., they will send out their own L.S.A.  This demonstrates a great deal of unnecessary network traffic. Figure four shows the same topology as figure three. However, now the network has one router elected as the designated router and one as the backup designated router.  The other routers send their L.S.A. only to these two routers.  The D.R. will then send out the L.S.A. to the other routers.  This greatly reduces network traffic.</div>
