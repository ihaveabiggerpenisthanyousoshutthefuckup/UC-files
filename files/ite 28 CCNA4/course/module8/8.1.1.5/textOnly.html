          <p>When documenting the network, it is often necessary to gather information directly from routers and switches. Obvious useful network documentation commands include<b> ping</b>,<b> traceroute</b>, and<b> telnet </b>as well as the following<b> show </b>commands: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The<b> show ip interface brief </b>and<b> show ipv6 interface brief </b>commands are used to display the up or down status and IP address of all interfaces on a device. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The<b> show ip route </b>and<b> show ipv6 route </b>commands are used to display the routing table in a router to learn the directly connected neighbors, more remote devices (through learned routes), and the routing protocols that have been configured. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The<b> show cdp neighbors detail </b>command is used to obtain detailed information about directly connected Cisco neighbor devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure lists some of the most common Cisco IOS commands used for data collection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Manual data collection using<b> show </b>commands on individual network devices is extremely time consuming and is not a scalable solution. Manual collection of data should be reserved for smaller networks or limited to mission-critical network devices. For simpler network designs, baseline tasks typically use a combination of manual data collection and simple network protocol inspectors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sophisticated network management software is typically used to baseline large and complex networks. These software packages enable administrators to automatically create and review reports, compare current performance levels with historical observations, automatically identify performance problems, and create alerts for applications that do not provide expected levels of service. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Establishing an initial baseline or conducting a performance-monitoring analysis may require many hours or days to accurately reflect network performance. Network management software or protocol inspectors and sniffers often run continuously over the course of the data collection process. </p>
