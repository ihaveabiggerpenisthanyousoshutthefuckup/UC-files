Figures one and two are interactive media elements that allow the learner to evaluate how routers process inbound and outbound A.C.L.s. Instruction Check your understanding of how routers process A C Ls. Drag each A C L process to its correct place in the flowchart. When you have completed the inbound A C L flowchart, click button 2 to continue this activity. There are 5 empty rectangles going across the screen. The first and last blank rectangles are contained within a rectangle. Blank rectangles two through four are within an outline of a decision box. After each decision box is a right arrow leading to the next box and the word no above it. Each decision box has a down arrow coming out of it labeled yes and leading to another blank decision box. The last rectangle on the right has a down arrow pointing to a trash can labeled packet discarded. The bottom decision box has a right arrow pointing to the same trash can and the arrow is labeled deny. The bottom decision box has a left arrow coming out of it labeled permit (towards routing table and destination interface). The available A.C.L. processes are as follows: permit or deny, Match 3rd a c l statement, match 1st a c l statement, inbound interface, match 2nd a c l statement, implicit deny any. Figure 2 has the same blank rectangles as Figure 1. On the left is labeled from routing table and outbound interface selection. The directions Check your understanding of how routers process ACLs. Drag each ACL process to its correct place in the flowchart. The available A c l processes are as follows: outbound interface, implicit deny any, match 3rd a c l statement, permit or deny, match 2nd a c l statement, match 1st a c l statement.
