Figure 1 has a 2 column table with a command in the left column and the description in the right column. The first command is show ip route which is used to verify routes advertised by the BGP neighbor are present in the IPv4 routing table. The next command is show ip bgp which is used to verify that received and advertised IPv4 networks are in the BGP table. The last command is show ip bgp summary which is used to verify BGP neighbors and other BGP information. Figure 2 shows how the edge router in AS 65000 Company-A received a default route through the BGP routing protocol via the neighbor router’s 209.165.201.1 interface. Figure 3 shows the Company-A router’s BGP table. The columns in the table are from the left to right: network, next hop, metric, locprf, weight, and path. The first entry is 0.0.0.0, 209.165.201.1 0, 0, 65001. The second entry is 198.133.219.0/24 0.0.0.0, 0, 32768, i. Figure 4 has the show ip bgp summary command output that includes the BGP router identifier for the Company-A router as 209.165.201.2, local AS number 65000. It also shows that IP address 209.165.201.1 is a neighbor and is in AS 65001. Figure 5 is the syntax checker to configure and verify eBGP.
