            <b>Implementing EtherChannel</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In hierarchical network design, some links between access and distribution switches may need to process a greater amount of traffic than other links. As traffic from multiple links converges onto a single, outgoing link, it is possible for that link to become a bottleneck.  Link aggregation allows an administrator to increase the amount of bandwidth between devices by creating one logical link made up of several physical links. EtherChannel is a form of link aggregation used in switched networks, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>EtherChannel uses the existing switch ports; therefore, additional costs to upgrade the link to a faster and more expensive connection are not necessary. The EtherChannel is seen as one logical link using an EtherChannel interface. Most configuration tasks are done on the EtherChannel interface, instead of on each individual port, ensuring configuration consistency throughout the links. Finally, the EtherChannel configuration takes advantage of load balancing between links that are part of the same EtherChannel, and depending on the hardware platform, one or more load-balancing methods can be implemented.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>EtherChannel operation and configuration will be covered in more detail in the chapter titled “Etherchannel and HSRP”. </p>
