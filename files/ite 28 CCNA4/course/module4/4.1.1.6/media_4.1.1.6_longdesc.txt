The A.C.L. operation statements are as follows: An Access Control List (A.C.L.) controls whether the router will blank or blank packet traffic based on packet header criteria. A.C.L.s are often used in routers between internal and external networks to provide a blank. A router with three interfaces and two network protocols (I.P.v.4 and I.P.v.6) can have as many as blank active A.C.L.s. For inbound A.C.L.s, incoming packets are processed blank routing has been performed. For outbound A.C.L.s, incoming packets are processed blank routing has been performed. For every A.C.L., there is an implied deny statement. If a packet does not match any of the A.C.L. criteria, it will be blank. A.C.L.s can filter data traffic per protocol, per direction, and per blank. A.C.L.s can filter traffic based on source/destination address, blank, and port numbers.
