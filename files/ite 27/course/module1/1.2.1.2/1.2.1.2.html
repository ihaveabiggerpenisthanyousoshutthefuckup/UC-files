        <h1>Port Density</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The port density of a switch refers to the number of ports available on a single switch. The figure shows the port density of three different switches.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Fixed configuration switches support a variety of port density configurations. The Cisco Catalyst 3850 24 port and 48 port switches are shown on the left in the figure. The 48 port switch has an option for four additional ports for small form-factor pluggable (SFP) devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Modular switches can support very high-port densities through the addition of multiple switch port line cards. The modular Catalyst 6500 switch shown on the right in the figure can support in excess of 1,000 switch ports. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Large networks that support many thousands of network devices require high density, modular switches to make the best use of space and power. Without using a high-density modular switch, the network would need many fixed configuration switches to accommodate the number of devices that need network access. This approach can consume many power outlets and a lot of closet space. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The network designer must also consider the issue of uplink bottlenecks: A series of fixed configuration switches may consume many additional ports for bandwidth aggregation between switches, for the purpose of achieving target performance. With a single modular switch, bandwidth aggregation is less of an issue, because the backplane of the chassis can provide the necessary bandwidth to accommodate the devices connected to the switch port line cards.</p>
