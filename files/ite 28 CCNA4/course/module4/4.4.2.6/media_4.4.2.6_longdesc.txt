Figure one shows the A.C.L. reference network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3.  R-1 has two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has only one active interface with the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 3 0 colon colon slash 64 on the gigabit zero slash one interface.  The serial WAN between R-1 and R-2 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 1 colon colon slash 64. The serial WAN between R-2 and R-3 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 2 colon colon slash 64. Figure two shows output for the commands show ipv6 access list and show running-config. The issue is that the A.C.L is applied in the wrong direction on the interface. Figure three shows the correct the A.C.L. by removing the statement and applying it in the correct direction. After PC1 tries to access the F.T.P. server again, the show access-list command shows the matches to the deny statement.
