        <h1>Network Traffic Trends</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In the early 2000s, the predominant types of IP traffic were voice and data. Voice traffic has a predictable bandwidth need and known packet arrival times. Data traffic is not real-time and has unpredictable bandwidth need. Data traffic can temporarily burst, as when a large file is being downloaded. This bursting can consume the entire bandwidth of a link.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>More recently, video traffic has become the increasingly important to business communications and operations.  According to the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI)</a>, video traffic represented 67% of all traffic in 2014. By 2019, video will represent 80% of all traffic. In addition, mobile video traffic will increase over 600% from 113,672 TB to 768,334 TB.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The type of demands voice, video, and data traffic place on the network are very different.</p>
