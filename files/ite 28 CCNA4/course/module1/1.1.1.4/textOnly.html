          <p>In slow economic times, many businesses focus on increasing their profitability by improving the efficiency of their existing operations, increasing employee productivity, and lowering operating costs. Establishing and managing networks can represent significant installation and operating expenses. To justify such a large expense, companies expect their networks to perform optimally and to be able to deliver an ever increasing array of services and applications to support productivity and profitability. </p>

          <p>The example used in this chapter is of a fictitious company called SPAN Engineering. This topic will illustrate how SPAN's network requirements change as the company grows from a small, local, business into a global enterprise.</p>
