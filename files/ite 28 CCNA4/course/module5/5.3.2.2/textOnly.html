          <p>The <b>show monitor</b> command is used to verify the SPAN session. The command displays the type of the session, the source ports for each traffic direction, and the destination port. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example shown in Figure 1, the session number is 1, the source port for both traffic directions is F0/1, and the destination port is F0/2. The ingress SPAN is disabled on the destination port, so only traffic that leaves the destination port is copied to that port.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to configure and verify local SPAN.</p>
