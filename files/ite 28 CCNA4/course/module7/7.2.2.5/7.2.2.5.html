        <h1>Abstraction Layers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To help explain how virtualization works, it is useful to use layers of abstraction in computer architectures. A computer system consists of the following abstraction layers, as illustrated in Figure 1:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Services</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>OS</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Firmware</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hardware</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At each of these layers of abstraction, some type of programming code is used as an interface between the layer below and the layer above. For example, the C programming language is often used to program the firmware that accesses the hardware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An example of virtualization is shown in Figure 2. A hypervisor is installed between the firmware and the OS. The hypervisor can support multiple instances of OSs.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows an example of computer architecture abstraction layers. Starting at the bottom and working our way up we have Hardware (CPU, Memory, NIC, Disk), above that is the firmware (ROM), above that is the OS, then above that is Services (web, Email, and File Servers). Figure 2 shows an example of the virtual architecture abstraction layers. Starting at the bottom and working our way up we have Hardware (CPU, Memory, NIC, Disk), above that is the firmware (ROM), above that is the Hypervisor, above that are three instance of the operating system all on the same level, and finally above that is the Services (Web server, Email server, and File server).</div>
