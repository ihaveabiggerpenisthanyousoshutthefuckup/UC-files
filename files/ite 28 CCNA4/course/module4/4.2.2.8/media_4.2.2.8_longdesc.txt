Figures one, two, three, and four are interactive media elements that allow the learner to evaluate extended A.C.L. statements. The topology for the four activities is found on Figure 1. LAN 1 is 192.168.1.0/24 and attaches through Fa0/0 on R1. A P.C. 192.168.1.66 is found on the LAN. A note pointing towards Fa0/0 on R1 states A.C.L. 103 is applied to Fa0/0 inbound. LAN 2 also attaches to R1 through Fa0/1. LAN 2 is 192.168.2.0/24. S0/0/0 on R1 connects to S0/0/0 on R2 and is network 172.16.1.0/30. Fa0/0 on R2 is used to connect to LAN 3 172.16.3.0/24. A server resides on LAN 3 and it has the I.P. address of 172.16.3.200. Fa0/1 on R2 is used to connect to LAN 4 192.168.4.0/24. A PC resides on LAN 4 and has the i.p. address of 192.168.4.12. The instructions state to click buttons 2, 3, and 4 to complete the activity. Click button 1 to review the topology at any time. Figure 2 is an activity to evaluate extended A.C.L. statements. Scenario 1 – Refer to the topology in the first figure. This scenario provides the extended A.C.L. 103 and the source and destination combinations in the table. Based on this information, determine whether packets will be permitted or denied. Drag the word permit or the word deny to the field next to the source and destination combination. Click button 3 to continue. The five line access list is as follows: access-list 103 permit i.p. host 192.168.1.66 host 192.168.3.75, access-list 103 permit i.p. host 192.168.1.77 host 192.168.3.75, access-list 103 deny i.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.1168.3.75, access-list 103 deny i.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255, access-list 103 permit i.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255. There is a 3 column table for the activity. One column has source i.p. addresses. One column has destination i.p. addresses. The third column has the heading of permit or deny and contains an empty rectangle. The first set of source and destination i.p. addresses are 192.168.1.66 and 192.168.3.51. The second set is 192.168.1.66 and 192.168.3.75. The third set is 192.168.1.88 and 192.168.3.51. The fourth set of addresses are 192.168.1.88 and 192.168.3.75. The fifth set contains 192.168.1.77 and 192.168.3.75. The last set contains 192.168.1.33 and 192.168.2.34. Figure 3 instructions Scenario 2 – Refer to the topology in the first figure. This scenario provides the extended A.C.L. 104 and the source and destination combinations in the table. Based on this information, determine whether packets will be permitted or denied. Drag Permit or Deny to the field next to each source and destination combination. Click Button 4 to continue. The four line access list is as follows: access-list 104 deny t.c.p. host 192.168.1.66 host 192.168.3.200 e.q. 80, access-list 104 permit t.c.p. host 192.168.1.77 host 192.168.3.75 e.q. 22, access-list 104 deny i.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255, access-list 104 permit i.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255. The figure contains a four column table with source i.p. address, destination i.p. address, protocol and a blank rectangle under the permit or deny column. The first set of parameters are as follows: 192.168.1.66 192.168.3.20 h.t.t.p. The second row contains 192.168.1.66, 192.168.4.75, and s.s.h. Third row is 192.168.1.77, 192,168.3.75, and h.t.t.p. Fourth row is 192.168.1.88, 192.168.2.75, and h.t.t.p. Fifth row is 192.168.1.77, 192.168.3.75, and s.s.h. The last row contains 192.168.1.66, 192.168.3.200, and http.Figure 4 contains instructions for scenario 3 – refer to the topology in the first figure. This scenario provides the extended a.c.l. 105 and the source and destination combinations in the table. Based on this information, determine whether packets will be permitted or denied. Drag Permit or Deny to the field next to each source and destination combination. Access list 105 has 4 lines: access-list 105 permit t.c.p. 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.3.200 e.q. 80, access-list 105 permit i.p. host 192.168.1.66 host 192.168.3.200, access-list 105 permit t.c.p 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.4.12 e.q. 22, access-list 105 permit t.c.p. host 192.168.1.66 192.168.2.0 0.0.,0.255 e.q. 23. Figure 4 has a four column table with the 4 column headings as follows: source, destination, protocol, and permit or deny. The permit or deny column contains blank rectangles under the heading. The first row is 192.168.1.67, 192.168.2.88, h.t.t.p. The second row is 192.168.1.66, 192.168.4.12, s.s.h. The third row is 192.168.1.77, 192.168.3.75, h.t.t.p. The fourth row is 192.168.1.66, 192.168.2.75, and Telnet. The fifth row is 192.168.1.77, 192.168.2.75, and Telnet. The last row contains 192.168.1.66, 192.168.3.200, and Telnet.
