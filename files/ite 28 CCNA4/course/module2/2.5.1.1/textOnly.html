          <p></p>
          <p>Three friends who are enrolled in the Cisco Networking Academy want to check their knowledge of PPP network configuration.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>They set up a contest where each person will be tested on configuring PPP with defined PPP scenario requirements and varying options. Each person devises a different configuration scenario.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The next day they get together and test each otherâ€™s configuration using their PPP scenario requirements.</p>
