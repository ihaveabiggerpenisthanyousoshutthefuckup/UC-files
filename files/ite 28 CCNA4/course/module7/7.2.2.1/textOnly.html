          <p>The terms “cloud computing” and “virtualization” are often used interchangeably; however, they mean different things. Virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing. Without it, cloud computing, as it is most-widely implemented, would not be possible.</p>

          <p>Cloud computing separates the application from the hardware. Virtualization separates the OS from the hardware. Various providers offer virtual cloud services that can dynamically provision servers as required. For example, Amazon Elastic Compute cloud (Amazon EC2) web service provides a simple way for customers to dynamically provision the compute resources they need. These virtualized instances of servers are created on demand in Amazon’s EC2.</p>
