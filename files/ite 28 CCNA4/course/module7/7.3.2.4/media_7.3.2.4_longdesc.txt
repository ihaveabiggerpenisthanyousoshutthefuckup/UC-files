The figure shows the ACI Spine-Leaf Topology. At the top the topology is the Spine with two Cisco Nexus 9500 switches. Each of the two 9500 switches are connected to four Cisco Nexus 9300 switches using 40 gigabit Ethernet links. The 9300 switches are part of the Leaf layer. The four 9300 switches are connected to a server labeled “All other network devices” using multiple 10 gigabit Ethernet links. The diagram also shows the 9300 switches connected to a box showing the word APIC with the symbols of a clock, an alarm, a lock and a person.
