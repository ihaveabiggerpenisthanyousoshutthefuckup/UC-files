        <h1>The Need to Scale the Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Businesses increasingly rely on their network infrastructure to provide mission-critical services. As businesses grow and evolve, they hire more employees, open branch offices, and expand into global markets. These changes directly affect the requirements of a network. </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>A network must support the exchange of various types of network traffic, including data files, email, IP telephony, and video applications for multiple business units. All enterprise networks must:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Support critical applications </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Support converged network traffic</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Support diverse business needs</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide centralized administrative control</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The LAN is the networking infrastructure that provides access to network communication services and resources for end users and devices spread over a single floor or building. You create a campus network by interconnecting a group of LANs that are spread over a small geographic area. Campus network designs include small networks that use a single LAN switch, up to very large networks with thousands of connections.</p>
