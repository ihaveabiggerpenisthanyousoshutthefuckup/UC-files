Figure 1 shows how to verify that all necessary interfaces are up with the same topology as before with the exception that R1 on the left has a LAN represented by Loopback 0 interface 10.0.0.1 and R2 has a LAN represented by loopback interface 0 172.16.0.1. The show ip interface brief command is issued on both R1 and R2 in order to verify that the serial interfaces and tunnel interfaces are up and up. Figure 2 shows that the LANs represented by the loopback interfaces are learned through OSPF and the Tunnel0 interface on both routers R1 and R2.
