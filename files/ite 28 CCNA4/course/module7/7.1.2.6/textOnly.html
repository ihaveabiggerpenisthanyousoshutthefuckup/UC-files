          <p>The Application Enablement Platform pillar provides the infrastructure for application hosting and application mobility between cloud and Fog computing. The Fog environment allows for multiple instances of the application across different end devices and sensors. These instances can communicate with each other for redundancy and data-sharing purposes to create business models such pay-as-you-go consumption for objects, machines, and products.</p>

          <p>For example, Cisco IOx which is a combination of Cisco IOS and Linux, allows routers to host applications close to the objects they need to monitor, control, analyze, and optimize. Cisco IOx services are offered on multiple hardware devices that are customized for various industry needs and can therefore support applications specific to those industries.</p>
