          <p>In its simplest form, FIFO queuing, also known as first-come, first-served (FCFS) queuing, involves buffering and forwarding of packets in the order of arrival.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>FIFO has no concept of priority or classes of traffic and consequently, makes no decision about packet priority. There is only one queue, and all packets are treated equally. Packets are sent out an interface in the order in which they arrive, as shown in the figure. Although some traffic is more important or time-sensitive based on the priority classification, notice that the traffic is sent out in the order it is received.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When FIFO is used, important or time-sensitive traffic can be dropped when congestion occurs on the router or switch interface. When no other queuing strategies are configured, all interfaces except serial interfaces at E1 (2.048 Mbps) and below use FIFO by default. (Serial interfaces at E1 and below use WFQ by default.)</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>FIFO, which is the fastest method of queuing, is effective for large links that have little delay and minimal congestion. If your link has very little congestion, FIFO queuing may be the only queuing you need to use.</p>
