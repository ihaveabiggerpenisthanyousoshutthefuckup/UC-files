        <h1>Server Virtualization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Server virtualization takes advantage of idle resources and consolidates the number of required servers. This also allows for multiple operating systems to exist on a single hardware platform.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, in the figure, the previous eight dedicated servers have been consolidated into two servers using hypervisors to support multiple virtual instances of the operating systems.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The hypervisor is a program, firmware, or hardware that adds an abstraction layer on top of the real physical hardware. The abstraction layer is used to create virtual machines which have access to all the hardware of the physical machine such as CPUs, memory, disk controllers, and NICs. Each of these virtual machines runs a complete and separate operating system. With virtualization, enterprises can now consolidate the number of servers they require. For example, it is not uncommon for 100 physical servers to be consolidated as virtual machines on top of 10 physical servers that are using hypervisors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The use of virtualization normally includes redundancy to protect from a single point of failure. Redundancy can be implemented in different ways. If the hypervisor fails, the VM can be restarted on another hypervisor. Also, the same VM can be run on two hypervisors concurrently, copying the RAM and CPU instructions between them. If one hypervisor fails, the VM continues running on the other hypervisor. The services running on the VMs are also virtual and can be dynamically installed or uninstalled, as needed.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure hypervisor OS installation displays the hypervisor structure on two servers. The hardware component is at the lowest level with the hypervisor on top of the hardware. Connected to the hypervisor are four instances of the operating system. For server 1 there are four instances of the Windows OS. On server 1, above the four instances of the Windows OS are services for Web Server, Email Server, SQL server and File server. For server 2 there are two instances of the Windows OS and two instances of a Linux OS. On server 2, above the two instances of the Windows OS are services for DHCP server and AD server. On server 2, above the two instances of the Linux OS are services Radius server and NMS server.</div>
