          <p>Developments in broadband wireless technology are increasing wireless availability through three main technologies:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Municipal Wi-Fi</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cellular/mobile</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Satellite Internet</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Municipal Wi-Fi</b>
          </p>
          <p>Many municipal governments, often working with service providers, are deploying wireless networks. Some of these networks provide high-speed Internet access at no cost or for substantially less than the price of other broadband services. Other cities reserve their Wi-Fi networks for official use, providing police, fire fighters, and city workers remote access to the Internet and municipal networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most municipal wireless networks use a mesh of interconnected access points, as shown in Figure 1. Each access point is in range and can communicate with at least two other access points. The mesh blankets a particular area with radio signals.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Cellular/Mobile </b>
          </p>
          <p>Mobile phones use radio waves to communicate through nearby cell towers. The mobile phone has a small radio antenna. The provider has a much larger antenna that sits at the top of a tower, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Three common terms that are used when discussing cellular/mobile networks include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wireless Internet</b> - A general term for Internet services from a mobile phone or from any device that uses the same technology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>2G/3G/4G Wireless</b> - Major changes to the mobile phone companies’ wireless networks through the evolution of the second, third, and fourth generations of wireless mobile technologies.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Long-Term Evolution (LTE)</b> - A newer and faster technology considered to be part of 4G technology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cellular/mobile broadband access consists of various standards. Variations include 2G using GSM, CDMA, or TDMA; 3G using UMTS, CDMA2000, EDGE, or HSPA+; and 4G, using LTE. A mobile phone subscription does not necessarily include a mobile broadband subscription. Cellular speeds continue to increase. For example, LTE Category 10 supports up to 450 Mb/s download and 100 Mb/s upload.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Satellite Internet</b>
          </p>
          <p>Satellite Internet services are used in locations where land-based Internet access is not available, or for temporary installations that are mobile. Internet access using satellites is available worldwide, including for providing Internet access to vessels at sea, airplanes in flight, and vehicles moving on land.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 illustrates a two-way satellite system that provides Internet access to a home subscriber. Upload speeds are about one-tenth of the download speed. Download speeds range from 5 Mb/s to 25 Mb/s.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The primary installation requirement is for the antenna to have a clear view toward the equator, where most orbiting satellites are stationed. Trees and heavy rains can affect reception of the signals.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a wireless technology for both fixed and mobile implementations. WiMAX may still be relevant for some areas of the world. Click <a href="http://www.nibletz.com/international/intel-capital-wimax-is-not-dead" target="_blank">here</a> to read about Intel Capital’s recent investments in WiMAX. However, in most of the world, WiMAX has largely been replaced by LTE for mobile access and cable or DSL for fixed access. Sprint shut down its WiMAX networks in early 2016.
