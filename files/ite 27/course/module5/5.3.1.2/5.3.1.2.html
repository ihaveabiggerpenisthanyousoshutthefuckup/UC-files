        <h1>Dijkstra&#x0027;s Algorithm</h1>
        <div>
          <p>All link-state routing protocols apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the best path route. The algorithm is commonly referred to as the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. This algorithm uses accumulated costs along each path, from source to destination, to determine the total cost of a route. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the figure, each path is labeled with an arbitrary value for cost. The cost of the shortest path for R2 to send packets to the LAN attached to R3 is 27. Each router determines its own cost to each destination in the topology. In other words, each router calculates the SPF algorithm and determines the cost from its own perspective.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The focus of this section is on cost, which is determined by the SPF tree. For this reason, the graphics throughout this section show the connections of the SPF tree, not the topology. All links are represented with a solid black line. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle, and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure has link costs on each link between routers, which is the basis of the Dijkstra’s Shortest Path First Algorithm.  An example is listed that shows 2 routes for data to travel between router R-2 and router R-4.  One path has a cost of 20 for link one, plus a cost of 20 for link 2, for a total cost of 40.  The second path has a cost of 20 for link one, plus a cost of 5 for link 2, plus a cost of 10 for link three, for a total cost of 35.  The latter path will be selected because of the lower path cost, even though it involves one more router.</div>
