          <p>GRE is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco that can encapsulate a wide variety of protocol packet types inside IP tunnels, creating a virtual point-to-point link to Cisco routers at remote points over an IP internetwork. IP tunneling using GRE enables network expansion across a single-protocol backbone environment. It does this by connecting multiprotocol subnetworks in a single-protocol backbone environment.</p>
          <p>GRE has these characteristics:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>GRE is defined as an IETF standard (RFC 2784).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the outer IP header, 47 is used in the protocol field to indicate that a GRE header will follow.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>GRE encapsulation uses a protocol type field in the GRE header to support the encapsulation of any OSI Layer 3 protocol. Protocol Types are defined in RFC 1700 as "EtherTypes".</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>GRE itself is stateless; by default, it does not include any flow-control mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>GRE does not include any strong security mechanisms to protect its payload.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The GRE header, together with the tunneling IP header indicated in the figure, creates at least 24 bytes of additional overhead for tunneled packets.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
