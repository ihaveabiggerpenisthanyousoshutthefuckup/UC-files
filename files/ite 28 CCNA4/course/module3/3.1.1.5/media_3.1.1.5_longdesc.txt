Figure 1 shows a city map that has an overlay of a cloud showing a municipal WiFi (mesh) implementation. Inside the cloud are 5 access points that connect to each adjacent access point. 3 of the access points connect to a wireless router labeled backhaul node. There is a lightning bolt WAN connection that goes from the cloud to a building labeled to the Internet. Figure 2 shows a tower with multiple wireless antennas attached. Figure 3 is labeled two-way satellite implementation. A home with a computer inside it has an antenna connected. This home is labeled satellite service subscriber. Wireless signals extend from the home antenna to a satellite in the sky and from the sky satellite to another building with an antenna that is labeled satellite Internet service provider (ISP).
