Figure 1 shows the MTU and MSS. The figure shows 5 rectangles labeled from left to right as follows: Ethernet, IPv4, TCP, payload, and FCS. There are three lines of arrows above the rectangles. The top arrow extends across the payload rectangle and is labeled TCP MSS. The second arrow down from the top extends from the IPv4 rectangle to the far right side of the payload rectangle and is labeled IP MTU. The third arrow down from the top extends from the same rectangles (IPv4, TCP, and Payload) and is labeled Ethernet MTU. Under the IPv4 box is 20 bytes. Under the TCP box is 20 bytes. Under the payload box is 1460 bytes. The arrow showing the amount of data contained in the IPv4, TCP, and payload boxes is labeled 1500 bytes. Figure 2 shows the adjusted MSS with PPPoE header. There are 6 rectangles labeled from left to right as follows: Ethernet, PPPoE, IPv4, TCP, payload, and FCS. There are three lines of arrows above the rectangles. The top arrow spans across the payload rectangle and is labeled TCP MSS. The second arrow down from the top extends from the IPv4 rectangle to the far right side of the payload rectangle and is labeled IP MTU. The third arrow down from the top extends from the same rectangles (IPv4, TCP, and Payload) and is labeled Ethernet MTU. Under the PPPoE box is 8 bytes, Under the IPv4 box is 20 bytes. Under the TCP box is 20 bytes. Under the payload box is 1452 bytes. The arrow showing the amount of data contained in the IPv4, TCP, and payload boxes is labeled 1492 bytes. Figure 3 shows how to verify the MTU size on the dialer interface.On the left is a LAN connected to the R1 customer router labeled G0/0. Coming out of the right of R1 via G0/1 is a cable that goes to a modem. G0/1 is labeled .1 and the modem is labeled 10.1.3.0/24. The modem connects to another modem located inside the ISP cloud. The ISP modem connects to router R2 via interface G0/1 that is labeled .2. R2 is also inside the ISP cloud. The following output is shown: R1# show running-config | section interface dialer2, interface dialer2, (the following line is highlighted) mtu 1492, ipa ddress negotiated, encapsulation ppp, <output omitted>. Figure 4 is the same topology as Figure 3 and shows adjusting the TCP MSS. The following output is shown: R1(config)# interface g0/0, R1(config-if)# ip tcp adjust-mss 1452.
