        <h1>What is the IoT?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a very short time, the Internet has dramatically changed how we work, live, play, and learn. Yet, we have barely scratched the surface. Using existing and new technologies, we are connecting the physical world to the Internet. It is by connecting the unconnected that we transition from the Internet to the Internet of Things (IoT). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>From its humble beginning as the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in 1969, when it interconnected a few sites, it is now predicted that the Internet will interconnect 50 billion things by 2020. The IoT refers to the network of these physical objects accessible through the Internet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Fifty billion things provide trillions of gigabytes of data. How can they work together to enhance our decision-making and interactions to improve our lives and our businesses? Enabling these connections are the networks that we use daily.</p>
