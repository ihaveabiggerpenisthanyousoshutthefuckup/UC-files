          <p>Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) authenticates and encrypts packets over the network to provide secure access to devices. Adding authentication and encryption to SNMPv3 addresses the vulnerabilities of earlier versions of SNMP.</p>

          <p>SNMPv3 authenticates and encrypts packets over the network to provide secure access to devices, as shown in the figure. This addressed the vulnerabilities of earlier versions of SNMP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SNMPv3 provides three security features:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Message integrity and authentication</b> - Transmissions from the SNMP manager (NMS) to agents (managed nodes) can be authenticated to guarantee the identity of the sender and the integrity and timeliness of a message. This ensures that a packet has not been tampered with in transit, and is from a valid source.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Encryption</b> - SNMPv3 messages may be encrypted to ensure privacy. Encryption scrambles the contents of a packet to prevent it from being seen by an unauthorized source.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Access control</b> - Restricts SNMP managers to certain actions on specific portions of data. For example, you may not want the NMS to have full access to your firewall device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
