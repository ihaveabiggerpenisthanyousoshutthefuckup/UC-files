Figure one is a flow chart depicting the inbound A.C.L. process. The first box on the left says inbound interface. This feeds into a decision box match 1st a.c.e. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process feeds into the match 2nd A.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process goes to the match 3rd a.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, an implicit deny any is applied and the packet is discarded. At any process step, the process could be a yes on a match for an A.C.E. If the A.C.E statement contains a deny, then the packet is discarded. If the A.C.E. statement contains permit, then the packet is sent to the routing table and destination interface. Figure two is a flow chart depicting the outbound A.C.L. process. A rectangle on the left shows information from the routing table and outbound interface selection going into the first decision of whether the first a.c.e matches. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process feeds into the match 2nd A.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, the process goes to the match 3rd a.c.e. decision. If yes, the process goes into the permit or deny decision box described later. If no, an implicit deny any is applied and the packet is discarded. At any process step, the process could be a yes on a match for an A.C.E. If the A.C.E statement contains a deny, then the packet is discarded. If the A.C.E. statement contains permit, then the packet is sent to the outbound interface.
