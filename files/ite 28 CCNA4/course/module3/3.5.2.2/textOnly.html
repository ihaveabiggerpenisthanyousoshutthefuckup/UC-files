          <p>BGP should not be used when at least one of the following conditions exist:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is a single connection to the Internet or another AS. This is known as single-homed. In this case, Company-A may run an IGP with the ISP or, Company-A and the ISP will each use static routes, as shown in the figure. Although it is recommended only in unusual situations, for the purposes of this course, you will configure single-homed BGP.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When there is a limited understanding of BGP.  A misconfiguration of a BGP router can have far reaching affects beyond the local AS, negatively impacting routers throughout the Internet.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: There are some single-homed situations where BGP may be appropriate, such as the need for a specific routing policy. However, routing policies are beyond the scope of this course.</p>
