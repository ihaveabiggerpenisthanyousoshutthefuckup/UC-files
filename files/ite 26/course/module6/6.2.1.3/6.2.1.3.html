        <h1>Assigning Ports to VLANs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>After creating a VLAN, the next step is to assign ports to the VLAN. An access port can belong to only one VLAN at a time. One exception to this rule is that of a port connected to an IP phone, in which case, there are two VLANs associated with the port: one for voice and one for data.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays the syntax for defining a port to be an access port and assigning it to a VLAN. The<b> switchport mode access</b> command is optional, but strongly recommended as a security best practice. With this command, the interface changes to permanent access mode.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Use the<b> interface range</b> command to simultaneously configure multiple interfaces.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example in Figure 2, VLAN 20 is assigned to port F0/18 on switch S1; therefore, the student computer (PC2) is in VLAN 20. VLANs are configured on the switch port, not on the device. PC2 is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask associated with the VLAN which is configured on the switch port, VLAN 20 in this example.  When VLAN 20 is configured on other switches, the network administrator knows to configure the other student computers to be in the same subnet as PC2 (172.17.20.0/24). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 3 to assign a VLAN and use the<b> show vlan brief </b>command to display the contents of the vlan.dat file. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> switchport access vlan </b>command forces the creation of a VLAN if it does not already exist on the switch. For example, VLAN 30 is not present in the<b> show vlan brief </b>output of the switch. If the<b> switchport access vlan 30 </b>command is entered on any interface with no previous configuration, then the switch displays the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <span class="cmd">% Access VLAN does not exist. Creating vlan 30</span>
          </p>
