        <h1>Components of Troubleshooting OSPF</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As shown in the figure, OSPF problems usually relate to:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Neighbor adjacencies</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Missing routes</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Path selection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When troubleshooting neighbor issues, verify if the router has established adjacencies with neighboring routers using the OSPFv2 <b>show ip ospf neighbor</b> command. If there is no adjacency, then the routers cannot exchange routes. Verify if interfaces are operational and enabled for OSPFv2 using the<b> show ip interface brief </b>and the<b> show ip ospf interface </b>commands. If the interfaces are operational and enabled for OSPFv2, ensure that interfaces on both routers are configured for the same OSPFv2 area and the interfaces are not configured as passive interfaces.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If adjacency between two routers is established, verify that there are OSPFv2 routes in the IPv4 routing table using the<b> show ip route ospf </b>command. If there are no OSPFv2 routes, verify that there are no other routing protocols with lower administrative distances running in the network. Verify if all of the required networks are advertised into OSPFv2. Also verify if an access list is configured on a router that would filter either incoming or outgoing routing updates. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If all of the required routes are in the routing table, but the path that traffic takes is not correct, verify the OSPFv2 cost on interfaces on the path. Also be careful in cases where the interfaces are faster than 100 Mb/s, because all interfaces above this bandwidth have the same OSPFv2 cost, by default.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The commands and processes are similar for OSPFv3. For the equivalent OSPFv3 command, simply substitute<b> ip </b>with<b> ipv6</b>.</p>
