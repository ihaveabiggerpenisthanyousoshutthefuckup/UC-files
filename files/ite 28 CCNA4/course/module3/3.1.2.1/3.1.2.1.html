        <h1>Comparing Broadband Solutions</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each broadband solution has advantages and disadvantages. The ideal is to have a fiber-optic cable directly connected to the SOHO network. Some locations have only one option, such as cable or DSL. Some locations only have broadband wireless options for Internet connectivity.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If there are multiple broadband solutions available, a cost-versus-benefit analysis should be performed to determine the best solution.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some factors to consider in making a decision include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cable </b>- Bandwidth is shared by many users, upstream data rates are often slow during high-usage hours in areas with over-subscription.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>DSL </b>- Limited bandwidth that is distance sensitive (in relation to the ISPâ€™s central office), upstream rate is proportionally quite small compared to downstream rate.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Fiber-to-the-Home </b>- Requires fiber installation directly to the home (shown in the figure).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cellular/Mobile </b>- Coverage is often an issue, even within a SOHO where bandwidth is relatively limited.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wi-Fi Mesh </b>- Most municipalities do not have a mesh network deployed; if it is available and the SOHO is in range, then it is a viable option.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Satellite </b>- Expensive, limited capacity per subscriber; often provides access where no other access is possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
