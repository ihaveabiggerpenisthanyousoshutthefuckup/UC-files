          <p>IPv6 ACLs are similar to IPv4 ACLs in both operation and configuration. Being familiar with IPv4 access lists makes IPv6 ACLs easy to understand and configure.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In IPv4 there are two types of ACLs, standard and extended. Both types of ACLs can be either numbered or named ACLs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With IPv6, there is only one type of ACL, which is equivalent to an IPv4 extended named ACL. There are no numbered ACLs in IPv6. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An IPv4 ACL and an IPv6 ACL cannot share the same name.</p>
