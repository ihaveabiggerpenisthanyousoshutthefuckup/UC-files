        <h1>Link-State Operation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To maintain routing information, OSPF routers complete the following generic link-state routing process to reach a state of convergence: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>1. Establish Neighbor Adjacencies (Figure 1) - OSPF-enabled routers must recognize each other on the network before they can share information. An OSPF-enabled router sends Hello packets out all OSPF-enabled interfaces to determine if neighbors are present on those links. If a neighbor is present, the OSPF-enabled router attempts to establish a neighbor adjacency with that neighbor. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>2. Exchange Link-State Advertisements (Figure 2) - After adjacencies are established, routers then exchange link-state advertisements (LSAs). LSAs contain the state and cost of each directly connected link. Routers flood their LSAs to adjacent neighbors. Adjacent neighbors receiving the LSA immediately flood the LSA to other directly connected neighbors, until all routers in the area have all LSAs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>3. Build the Topology Table (Figure 3) - After LSAs are received, OSPF-enabled routers build the topology table (LSDB) based on the received LSAs. This database eventually holds all the information about the topology of the network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>4. Execute the SPF Algorithm (Figures 4 and 5) - Routers then execute the SPF algorithm. The gears in the figure are used to indicate the execution of the SPF algorithm. The SPF algorithm creates the SPF tree. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The contents of the R1 SPF tree are displayed in Figure 6.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>From the SPF tree, the best paths are offered to the IP routing table. The route will be inserted into the routing table unless there is a route source to the same network with a lower administrative distance, such as a static route. Routing decisions are made based on the entries in the routing table.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows 4 routers in a diamond pattern. Each router is directly connected to its two neighboring routers.  There is one router in the middle of the diamond pattern and it is connected to two of the other routers.  The figure is displaying Hello packets being sent and received by all neighboring routers. Figure two displays link state advertisements being sent and received by all routers. Figure three is highlighting one router beginning to build the topology table, which is currently empty. Figure four shows gears in a wheel representing that the router will use the shortest path first algorithm when building the topology table. Figure five shows a router branching off into multiple branches as in a family tree diagram.  This represents the S.P.F. tree. Figure six list the contents of the S.P.F. tree in a table.  The list contains all of the destination networks, the shortest path to reach those networks, and the total cost of each path.</div>
