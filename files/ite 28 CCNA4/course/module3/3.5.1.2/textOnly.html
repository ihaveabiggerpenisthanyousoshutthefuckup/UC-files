          <p>Two routers exchanging BGP routing information are known as BGP peers. As shown in the figure, there are two types of BGP:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>External BGP (eBGP)</b> â€“ External BGP is the routing protocol used between routers in different autonomous systems.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Internal BGP (iBGP)</b> - Internal BGP is the routing protocol used between routers in the same AS.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>This course focuses on eBGP only.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> There are some differences in how BGP operates depending on whether the two routers are eBGP peers or iBGP peers. However, these differences are beyond the scope of this course.</p>
