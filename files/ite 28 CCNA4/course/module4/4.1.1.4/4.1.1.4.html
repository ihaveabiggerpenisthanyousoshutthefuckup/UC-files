        <h1>ACL Packet Filtering</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Packet filtering controls access to a network by analyzing the incoming and outgoing packets and forwarding them or discarding them based on given criteria. Packet filtering can occur at Layer 3 or Layer 4. Standard ACLs only filter at Layer 3. Extended ACLs filter at Layer 3 and Layer 4. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, an ACL could be configured to logically, "Permit web access to users from network A but deny all other services to network A users. Deny HTTP access to users from network B, but permit network B users to have all other access." Refer to the figure to examine the decision path the packet filter uses to accomplish this task.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For this scenario, the packet filter looks at each packet as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the packet is a TCP SYN from Network A using Port 80, it is allowed to pass. All other access is denied to those users.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the packet is a TCP SYN from Network B using Port 80, it is blocked. However, all other access is permitted.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This is just a simple example. Multiple rules can be configured to further permit or deny services to specific users.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure is a flow chart used to represent the process of packet filtering. In the example, the A.C.L. is designed to look for packets requesting port 80 web services.  The first step is to determine which network the packet is coming from by looking at the frame header.  In the figure, there are two options, network A and network B.  Once the source network is determined, the next step is to determine whether the packet is requesting port 80 services by examining the T.C.P. header.  If the packet is from network A and is asking for port 80, the packet will be allowed.  If the packet is not asking for port 80, it will be denied.  The opposite is true for packets coming from network B. If the packet is from network B and is requesting port 80, the packet will be denied and all other requests will be allowed.</div>
