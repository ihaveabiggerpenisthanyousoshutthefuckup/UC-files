          <p>LCP provides an optional link quality determination phase. In this phase, LCP tests the link to determine whether the link quality is sufficient to use Layer 3 protocols. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> ppp quality </b><i>percentage </i>command ensures that the link meets the quality requirement set; otherwise, the link closes down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The percentages are calculated for both incoming and outgoing directions. The outgoing quality is calculated by comparing the total number of packets and bytes sent, to the total number of packets and bytes received by the destination node. The incoming quality is calculated by comparing the total number of packets and bytes received to the total number of packets and bytes sent by the destination node. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the link quality percentage is not maintained and the configured threshold, the link is deemed to be of poor quality and is taken down. LQM implements a time lag so that the link does not bounce up and down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The configuration <b>ppp quality 80</b>, shown in Figure 1, sets minimum quality to 80%.</p>

          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 2 to configure PPP encapsulation, compression, and LQM on router R1â€™s Serial 0/0/1 interface.</p>
