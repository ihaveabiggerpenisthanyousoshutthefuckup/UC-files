Figure shows the standard Live Equipment Lab graphic, indicating there is a live equipment lab for this section of the curriculum. The lab topology is a 3 router scenario. On the left P.C.A. connects to F0/6 on S1. S1 port F0/5 connects to G0/1 interface on R1 to create LAN 192.168.10.0/24. R1 also has a loopback 0 interface. S 0/0/0 (which is labeled with D.C.E.) connects to interface S0/0/0 on the I.S.P. router creating the 10.1.1.0/30 network. The I.S.P. router has loopback interfaces 0 and 1. Interface S0/0/1 (labeled D.C.E.) connects to interface S0/0/1 on R3 creating the 10.2.2.0/30 network. R3 has loopback 0 attached. R3 also has a connection to port F0/5 on S3 through interface G0/1. S3 has P.C.C attached through port F0/18. This is the 192.168.30.0/24 network.
