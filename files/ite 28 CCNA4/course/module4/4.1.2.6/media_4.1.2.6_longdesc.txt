Figure is an interactive activity. Instructions are as follows: Evaluate the network policies and determine the best placement for the A.C.L.s. Drag and drop the A.C.L. label to the appropriate place in the graphic. Network policy #1: Use a standard ACL to stop the 192.168.10.0/24 network from accessing the Internet through the ISP. Network policy #2: Use an extended A.C.L. to stop the 192.168.30.0/24 network from accessing the Web/TFTP server. The two A.C.L. labels are Standard ACL and Extended ACL. The topology is as follows with blank rectangles where noted. On the bottom left, PC1 connects to switch S1 that connects to Fa0/0 on router R1. That network is 192.168.10.0/24. There is a blank to the left of words R1 Fa0/0. PC2 connects to S2 which in turn connects to Fa0/1 on R1. That network is 192.168.11.0/24. S0/0/0 on R1 connects through a WAN connection to S0/0/0 on R2. There is a blank beside the R1 S0/0/0 interface. The web/T.F.T.P. server connects through Fa0/1 on R2 which has a blank above that interface. S0/1/0 on R2 connects to a cloud that has the ISP router in it. There is a blank above the R2 S0/1/0 interface. The S0/0/1 interface on R2 connects to the S0/0/1 interface on R3. There is a blank to the right of the S0/0/1 interface on R3. P.C. 3 connects to S3 which, in turn, connects to Fa0/1 on R3. There is a blank to the right of the Fa0/1 interface on R3.
