Figure 1 shows the GRE Tunnel Configuration topology with router R1 to the left connecting through S0/0/0 to the Internet cloud. Out the right side of the Internet cloud is a connection to router R2 via S0/0/0. A GRE tunnel cylinder is above the internet cloud. Both the left and right sides of the tunnel are labeled Tunnel 0. Figure 2 adds IP addressing information to the topology. Tunnel0 on the left is 192.168.2.1. Tunnel 0 on the right is 192.168.2.2. R1 S0/0/0 is 209.165.201.1 and R2 S0/0/0 is 198.133.219.87. The figure shows the tunnel and OSPF configuration commands for R1. Figure 3 shows the same topology and IP addressing information along with the tunnel and OSPF configuration for R2. Figure 4 has the commands used to create a GRE tunnel and a description of each command in a table. The table has 2 columnsâ€”command and description. The first command is tunnel mode gre ip which specifies that the mode of the tunnel interface is GRE over IP. The second command is tunnel source followed by an IP address. This command specifies the tunnel source address. The third command is tunnel destination followed by a IP address which is used to specify the tunnel destination address. The last command is ip address followed by an address and a subnet mask. This is used to specify the IP address of the tunnel interface.
