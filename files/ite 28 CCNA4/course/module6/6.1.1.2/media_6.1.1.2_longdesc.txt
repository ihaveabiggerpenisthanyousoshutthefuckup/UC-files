Figure shows three end devices, a web server, a PC, and an IP phone, they are send packets toward a router. The packets from the IP phone are marked as High Priority, the packets from the PC are marked as Medium Priority, and the packets from the web server are marked as Low Priority. The router mixes the packets from all three queues and sends to the network. An explanation box reads “All communication types have some access to the media. One particular type of traffic cannot take all of the bandwidth.”
