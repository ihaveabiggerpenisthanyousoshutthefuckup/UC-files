          <p>For SNMP to operate, the NMS must have access to the MIB. To ensure that access requests are valid, some form of authentication must be in place.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use community strings that control access to the MIB. Community strings are plaintext passwords. SNMP community strings authenticate access to MIB objects.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two types of community strings: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Read-only (ro) </b>- Provides access to the MIB variables, but does not allow these variables to be changed, only read. Because security is minimal in version 2c, many organizations use SNMPv2c in read-only mode.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Read-write (rw) </b>- Provides read and write access to all objects in the MIB.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To view or set MIB variables, the user must specify the appropriate community string for read or write access. </p>

            <b>Note</b>: Plaintext passwords are not considered a security mechanism. This is because plaintext passwords are highly vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, in which they are compromised through the capture of packets. </p>
