        <h1>Cloud Computing versus Data Center</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The terms data center and cloud computing are often incorrectly used. These are the correct definitions of data center and cloud computing:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Data center</b>: Typically a data storage and processing facility run by an in-house IT department or leased offsite.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cloud computing</b>: Typically an off-premise service that offers on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cloud computing is possible because of data centers. A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components. A data center can occupy one room of a building, one or more floors, or an entire building. Data centers are typically very expensive to build and maintain. For this reason, only large organizations use privately built data centers to house their data and provide services to users. Smaller organizations that cannot afford to maintain their own private data center can reduce the overall cost of ownership by leasing server and storage services from a larger data center organization in the cloud.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cloud computing is often a service provided by data centers, as shown in the figure. Cloud service providers use data centers to host their cloud services and cloud-based resources. To ensure availability of data services and resources, providers often maintain space in several remote data centers.</p>
