        <h1>OSPF Route Calculation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each router uses the SPF algorithm against the LSDB to build the SPF tree. The SPF tree is used to determine the best path(s). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the order in which the best paths are calculated is as follows:</p>
          <p>1. All routers calculate the best path(s) to destinations within their area (intra-area) and add these entries to the routing table. These are the type 1 and type 2 LSAs, which are noted in the routing table with a routing designator of O. (1)</p>
          <p>2. All routers calculate the best path(s) to the other areas within the internetwork. These best paths are the interarea route entries, or type 3 LSAs, and are noted with a routing designator of O IA. (2)</p>
          <p>3. All routers (except those that are in a form of stub area) calculate the best path(s) to the external autonomous system (type 5) destinations. These are noted with either an O E1 or an O E2 route designator, depending on the configuration. (3)</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When converged, a router can communicate with any network within or outside the OSPF routing domain.</p>
