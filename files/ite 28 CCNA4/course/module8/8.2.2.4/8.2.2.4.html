        <h1>Using a Syslog Server for Troubleshooting</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Syslog is a simple protocol used by an IP device known as a syslog client, to send text-based log messages to another IP device, the syslog server. Syslog is currently defined in RFC 5424. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Implementing a logging facility is an important part of network security and for network troubleshooting. Cisco devices can log information regarding configuration changes, ACL violations, interface status, and many other types of events. Cisco devices can send log messages to several different facilities. Event messages can be sent to one or more of the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Console </b>- Console logging is on by default. Messages log to the console and can be viewed when modifying or testing the router or switch using terminal emulation software while connected to the console port of the network device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Terminal lines </b>- Enabled EXEC sessions can be configured to receive log messages on any terminal lines. Similar to console logging, this type of logging is not stored by the network device and, therefore, is only valuable to the user on that line.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Buffered logging</b>
                <i></i>- Buffered logging is a little more useful as a troubleshooting tool because log messages are stored in memory for a time. However, log messages are cleared when the device is rebooted.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>SNMP traps </b>- Certain thresholds can be preconfigured on routers and other devices. Router events, such as exceeding a threshold, can be processed by the router and forwarded as SNMP traps to an external SNMP network management station. SNMP traps are a viable security logging facility, but require the configuration and maintenance of an SNMP system.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Syslog </b>- Cisco routers and switches can be configured to forward log messages to an external syslog service. This service can reside on any number of servers or workstations, including Microsoft Windows and Linux-based systems. Syslog is the most popular message logging facility, because it provides long-term log storage capabilities and a central location for all router messages.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cisco IOS log messages fall into one of eight levels, shown in Figure 1. The lower the level number, the higher the severity level. By default, all messages from level 0 to 7 are logged to the console. While the ability to view logs on a central syslog server is helpful in troubleshooting, sifting through a large amount of data can be an overwhelming task.  The<b> logging trap </b><i>level </i>command limits messages logged to the syslog server based on severity. The level is the name or number of the severity<i> level</i>. Only messages equal to or numerically lower than the specified<i> level </i>are logged.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the example in Figure 2, system messages from level 0 (emergencies) to 5 (notifications) are sent to the syslog server at 209.165.200.225.</p>
