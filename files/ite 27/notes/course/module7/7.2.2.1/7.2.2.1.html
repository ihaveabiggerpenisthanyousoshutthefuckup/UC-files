        <h1>Layer 3 Connectivity</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A prerequisite for a neighbor adjacency to form between two directly connected routers is Layer 3 connectivity. By examining the output of the<b> show ip interface brief </b>command, a network administrator can verify that the status and protocol of connecting interfaces are up. A ping from one router to another directly connected router, should confirm IPv4 connectivity between the devices. The figure displays the<b> show ip interface brief </b>command output for R1. R1 shows connectivity to R2, and pings are successful. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the ping is unsuccessful, use the<b> show cdp neighbor</b> command to verify the Layer 1 and 2 connections to the neighbor. If the output does not display the neighboring router, then verify Layer 1 and check the cabling, connections, and interfaces. If you see the neighbor in the output of the command, then Layer 1 and 2 are verified and points the problem to Layer 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Layer 3 problems include misconfigured IP addresses, subnets, network addressing, and more. For example, interfaces on connected devices must be on a common subnet. A log message that states that EIGRP neighbors are not on a common subnet indicates that there is an incorrect IPv4 address on one of the two EIGRP neighbor interfaces.</p>
          <p></p>

            <b>EIGRP for IPv6</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Similar commands and troubleshooting criteria also apply to EIGRP for IPv6.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The equivalent command used with EIGRP for IPv6 is<b> show ipv6 interface brief</b>.</p>
