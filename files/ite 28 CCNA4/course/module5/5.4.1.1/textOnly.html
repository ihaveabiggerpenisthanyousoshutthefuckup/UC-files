          <p>At Layer 2, a number of vulnerabilities exist that require specialized mitigation techniques:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>MAC address table flooding attacks are addressed with port security.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>VLAN attacks are controlled by disabling DTP and following basic guidelines for configuring trunk ports.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>DHCP attacks are addressed with DHCP snooping.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The SNMP protocol has three elements: the Manager, the Agent, and the MIB. The SNMP manager resides on the NMS, while the Agent and the MIB are on the client devices. The SNMP Manager can poll the client devices for information, or it can use a TRAP message that tells a client to report immediately if the client reaches a particular threshold. SNMP can also be used to change the configuration of a device. SNMPv3 is the recommended version because it provides security. SNMP is a comprehensive and powerful remote management tool. Nearly every item available in a <b>show</b> command is available through SNMP.</p>

          <p>Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) is used to mirror the traffic going to and/or coming from the host. It is commonly implemented to support traffic analyzers or IPS devices.</p>
