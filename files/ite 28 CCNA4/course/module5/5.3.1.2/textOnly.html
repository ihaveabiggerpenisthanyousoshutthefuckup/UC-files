          <p>The Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) feature on Cisco switches is a type of port mirroring that sends copies of the frame entering a port, out another port on the same switch. SPAN allows administrators or devices to collect and analyze traffic. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, SPAN is commonly implemented to deliver traffic to specialized devices including:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Packet analyzers </b>– Using software such as Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic for troubleshooting purposes. For example, an administrator can capture traffic destined to a server to troubleshoot the sub-optimal operation of a network application.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs)</b> –IPSs are focused on the security aspect of traffic and are implemented to detect network attacks as they happen, issuing alerts or even blocking the malicious packets as the attack takes place. IPSs are typically deployed as a service on an ISR G2 router or using a dedicated device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>While packet analyzers are commonly used for troubleshooting purposes, an IPS looks for specific patterns in traffic. As the traffic flows through the IPS, it analyzes traffic in real-time and takes action upon the discovery of malicious traffic patterns. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Modern networks are switched environments. Therefore, SPAN is crucial for effective IPS operation. SPAN can be implemented as either Local SPAN or Remote SPAN (RSPAN).</p>
