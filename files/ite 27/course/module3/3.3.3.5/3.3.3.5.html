        <h1>Repairing a Spanning Tree Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One way to correct spanning tree failure is to manually remove redundant links in the switched network, either physically or through configuration, until all loops are eliminated from the topology. When the loops are broken, the traffic and CPU loads should quickly drop to normal levels, and connectivity to devices should be restored.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although this intervention restores connectivity to the network, it is not the end of the troubleshooting process. All redundancy from the switched network has been removed, and now the redundant links must be restored.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the underlying cause of the spanning tree failure has not been fixed, chances are that restoring the redundant links will trigger a new broadcast storm. Before restoring the redundant links, determine and correct the cause of the spanning tree failure. Carefully monitor the network to ensure that the problem is fixed.</p>
