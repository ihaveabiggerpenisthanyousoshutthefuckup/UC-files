Figure shows two switches are interconnected with 802.1Q Trunk. An attacker PC is connected to the left switch. The right switch connects to Server1 on VLAN 10. It also connects Server2. The attacker attempts to gain VLAN access by configuring the PC to spoof a switch and use the 802.1Q trunking protocol and the Cisco-proprietary Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) feature to trunk with the left switch.
