Figure 1 shows the commands used to verify the GRE tunnel is up (show ip interface brief and interface Tunnel 0. Figure 2 shows that it is important to verify the routing protocol neighbor adjacency when a GRE tunnel is used, The example given for router R1 is show ip ospf neighbor. Figure 3 is the syntax checker to configure and verify a GRE tunnel. The same topology is used as in the previous figures and it shows the GRE Tunnel Configuration topology with router R1 to the left connecting through S0/0/0 to the Internet cloud. Out the right side of the Internet cloud is a connection to router R2 via S0/0/0. A GRE tunnel cylinder is above the internet cloud. Both the left and right sides of the tunnel are labeled Tunnel 0. Tunnel0 on the left is 192.168.2.1. Tunnel 0 on the right is 192.168.2.2. R1 S0/0/0 is 209.165.201.1 and R2 S0/0/0 is 198.133.219.87.
