      <div id="media-description">The figure is an interactive activity. Drag the appropriate word or phrase to complete the A.C.L. operation statements. Not all answers will be used. The first statement requires two words or phrases to complete it. The word or phrase is as follows: discarded before, four, interface, pathway, deny, after, processing, six, protocol, firewall, twelve, forwarded, and permit. The A.C.L. operation statements are as follows: An Access Control List (A.C.L.) controls whether the router will blank or blank packet traffic based on packet header criteria. A.C.L.s are often used in routers between internal and external networks to provide a blank. A router with three interfaces and two network protocols (I.P.v.4 and I.P.v.6) can have as many as blank active A.C.L.s. For inbound A.C.L.s, incoming packets are processed blank routing has been performed. For outbound A.C.L.s, incoming packets are processed blank routing has been performed. For every A.C.L., there is an implied deny statement. If a packet does not match any of the A.C.L. criteria, it will be blank. A.C.L.s can filter data traffic per protocol, per direction, and per blank. A.C.L.s can filter traffic based on source/destination address, blank, and port numbers.</div>
