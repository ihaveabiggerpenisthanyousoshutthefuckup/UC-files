Figure one shows a router with a packet going into a port. The packet will be processed by an inbound A.C.L. The figure also shows a packet exiting the router. This packet will be processed by an outbound A.C.L. Figure two shows a router with two active interfaces. The inbound and outbound interfaces are running I.P.v.4. and I.P.v.6..  With two interfaces and two protocols running, this router could have a total of eight separate A.C.L.s. applied.
