        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div>
          <p>VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) reduces administration of VLANs in a switched network. A switch configured as the VTP server distributes and synchronizes VLAN information over trunk links to VTP-enabled switches throughout the domain.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The three VTP modes are Server, Client and Transparent.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The configuration revision number is used when determining whether a VTP switch should keep or update its existing VLAN database. A switch will overwrite its existing VLAN database if it receives a VTP update from another switch in the same domain with a higher configuration revision number. Therefore, when a switch is being added to a VTP domain it must have the default VTP configuration or a lower configuration revision number than the VTP server.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Troubleshooting VTP can also involve dealing with errors caused by incompatible VTP Versions and incorrectly configured domain names or passwords. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Trunk negotiation is managed by the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), which operates on a point-to-point basis between network devices. DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that is automatically enabled on Catalyst 2960 and Catalyst 3560 Series switches. A general best practice when a trunk link is required is to set the interface to<b> trunk </b>and<b> nonegotiate</b>. On links where trunking is not intended, DTP should be turned off </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When troubleshooting DTP, problems can be related to trunk mode mismatches, allowed VLANS on a trunk and native VLAN mismatches. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Layer 3 switching using Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs) is a method of inter-VLAN routing that can be configured on Catalyst 2960 switches. An SVI with appropriate IP addressing is configured for each VLAN and provides Layer 3 processing for packets to or from all switch ports associated with those VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another method of Layer 3 inter-VLAN routing is using routed ports.  A routed port is a physical port that acts similarly to an interface on a router. Routed ports are mostly configured between switches in the core and distribution layer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Troubleshooting inter-VLAN routing with a router or a Layer 3 switch are similar. Common errors involve VLAN, trunk, Layer 3 interface, and IP address configurations.</p>
