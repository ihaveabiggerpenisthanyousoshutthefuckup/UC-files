            <b>ACL and Routing and ACL Processes on a Router</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure shows the logic of routing and ACL processes. When a packet arrives at a router interface, the router process is the same, whether ACLs are used or not. As a frame enters an interface, the router checks to see whether the destination Layer 2 address matches its interface Layer 2 address, or whether the frame is a broadcast frame. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the frame address is accepted, the frame information is stripped off and the router checks for an ACL on the inbound interface. If an ACL exists, the packet is tested against the statements in the list. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the packet matches a statement, the packet is either permitted or denied. If the packet is accepted, it is then checked against routing table entries to determine the destination interface. If a routing table entry exists for the destination, the packet is then switched to the outgoing interface, otherwise the packet is dropped. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Next, the router checks whether the outgoing interface has an ACL. If an ACL exists, the packet is tested against the statements in the list. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the packet matches a statement, it is either permitted or denied.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If there is no ACL or the packet is permitted, the packet is encapsulated in the new Layer 2 protocol and forwarded out the interface to the next device.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is a flow chart depicting the A.C.L. and routing process in a router. The first box has that the frame arrives on the router interface. That box feeds into a decision box. The decision is a yes/no one and asks if the Layer 2 address matches? If no, the frame is placed into a trash can. If yes, then the decision is a yes/no one that asks if ACLs are on the interface. If no, the packet is forwarded to an outbound interface. If yes, another decision must be made to determine if there is an ACL statement list  match? If no, then the default deny statement is applied and the packet trashed. If yes, a decision must be made to permit the packet. If the packet is not to be allowed, the packet is sent to the trash can. If the packet is to be permitted, the packet is forwarded to an outbound interface. Then a yes/no decision is to be made to determine if there are any ACLs on the interface. If no, the packet is sent to a device. If yes, then a yes/no decision is to be determine if one of the statements in the ACL is a match. If no, the default deny statement is applied and the packet is trashed. If yes, the decision of whether to permit the packet is made. If no, the packet is dropped (sent to a trash can). If yes, the packet is sent to the device.</div>
