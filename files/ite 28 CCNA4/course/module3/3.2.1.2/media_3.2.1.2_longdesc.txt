The figure shows tunneling to create a PPP link over Ethernet. On the left is PC1 with the IP address of 10.1.1.1. PC1 connects to the R1 router labeled customer. R1 connects to a modem labeled 10.1.3.1. Under the modem are two rectangles labeled from left to right as PPP and IP packet. There is an arrow coming out of the IP packet rectangle pointing to the cloud labeled ISP. The modem connects to another modem inside a cloud labeled ISP. The modem is labeled 10.1.3.2. The ISP modem connects to the R2 router also located inside the ISP cloud.
