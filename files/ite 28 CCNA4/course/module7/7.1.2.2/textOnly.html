          <p>Networking models describe how data flows within a network. Networking models include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Client-Server model</b> – (Figure 1) This is the most common model used in networks. Client devices request services of servers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cloud computing model </b>– (Figure 2) This is a newer model where servers and services are dispersed globally in distributed data centers. Cloud computing is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Fog computing</b> – (Figure 3) This IoT network model identifies a distributed computing infrastructure closer to the network edge. It enables edge devices to run applications locally and make immediate decisions. This reduces the data burden on networks as raw data does not need to be sent over network connections. It enhances resiliency by allowing IoT devices to operate when network connections are lost. It also enhances security by keeping sensitive data from being transported beyond the edge where it is needed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>These models are not mutually exclusive. Network administrators can use any combination of the three models to address the needs of the network users. The Fog computing pillar basically extends cloud connectivity closer to the edge. It enables end devices, such as smart meters, industrial sensors, robotic machines, and others, to connect to a local integrated computing, networking, and storage system.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Applications that use Fog computing can monitor or analyze real-time data from network-connected things and then take action such as locking a door, changing equipment settings, applying the brakes on a train, and more. For example, a traffic light can interact locally with a number of sensors that can detect the presence of pedestrians and bikers, and measure the distance and speed of approaching vehicles. The traffic light also interacts with neighboring lights providing a coordinated effort. Based on this information, the smart light sends warning signals to approaching vehicles and modifies its own cycle to prevent accidents. The data collected by the smart traffic light system is processed locally to do real-time analytics. Coordinating with neighboring smart traffic light systems in the Fog allows for any modification of the cycle. For example, it can change the timing of the cycles in response to road conditions or traffic patterns. The data from clusters of smart traffic light systems is sent to the cloud to analyze long-term traffic patterns.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cisco predicts that 40% of IoT-created data will be processed in the Fog by 2018.</p>
