Figure one shows five 8 bit wildcard masks.  Example one is, zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero, which will match all address bits in the octet.  Example two is, zero zero one one one one one one, which will match the first two bits and ignore that last six address bits.  Example three is zero zero zero zero one one one one will match the first four bits and ignore the last four bits.  Example four is one one one one one one zero zero, which will ignore the first six address bits and match the last two.  Example five is one one one one one one one one, which will ignore all the bits in the octet. Figure two lists three examples of I.P.v.4. addresses and wildcard masks.  Example one has a wildcard mask of 32 zeros, therefore it instructs the A.C.L. to match the exact I.P. address.  Example two has a wildcard mask of 32 ones, therefore any I.P. address will be a match.  Example three has a wildcard mask of 24 zeros starting from the left and working right, followed by eight ones.  This effectively matches a class C network where the first 24 bits are matched.
