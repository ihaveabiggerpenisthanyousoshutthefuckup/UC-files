          <p>The IoT greatly expands the size and diversity of the network to include the billions of smart objects that sense, monitor, control, and react. While networking these previously unconnected devices can deliver unparalleled levels of business and operational intelligence, it is essential to understand that operational environments are made up of multiple, disparate functional areas. Each of these areas also has distinctive requirements, including the need to track specific metrics. Operational technology systems can vary widely by industry, as well as by function in a given industry.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cisco delivers a broad range of IoT management and automation capabilities throughout the extended network. Cisco management and automation products can be customized for specific industries to provide enhanced security and control and support.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Cisco IoT System management and automation portfolio includes management tools such as the Cisco IoT Field Network Director shown in the figure. Other management tools include Cisco Prime, Cisco Video Surveillance Manager, and more.</p>
