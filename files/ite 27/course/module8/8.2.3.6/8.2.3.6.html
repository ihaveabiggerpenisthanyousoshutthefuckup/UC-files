        <h1>Manually Setting the OSPF Cost</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As an alternative to setting the default interface bandwidth, the cost can be manually configured on an interface using the<b> ip ospf cost </b><i>value </i>interface configuration command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An advantage of configuring a cost over setting the interface bandwidth is that the router does not have to calculate the metric when the cost is manually configured. In contrast, when the interface bandwidth is configured, the router must calculate the OSPF cost based on the bandwidth. The<b> ip ospf cost </b>command is useful in multi-vendor environments where non-Cisco routers may use a metric other than bandwidth to calculate the OSPFv2 costs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both the<b> bandwidth </b>interface command and the<b> ip ospf cost </b>interface command achieve the same result, which is to provide an accurate value for use by OSPFv2 in determining the best route.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For instance, in the example in Figure 1, the interface bandwidth of serial 0/0/1 is reset to the default value and the OSPF cost is manually set to 15,625. Although the interface bandwidth is reset to the default value, the OSPFv2 cost is set as if the bandwidth was still calculated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the two alternatives that can be used in modifying the costs of the serial links in the topology. The right side of the figure shows the<b> ip ospf cost </b>command equivalents of the<b> bandwidth </b>commands on the left.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the C.L.I. commands necessary for adjusting the O.S.P.F. cost on an interface manually.  The figure begins in global configuration mode, and the first command is interface serial zero slash zero slash one.  The next command is, no bandwidth 64.  The next command is, i.p. O.S.P.F. cost 15,625.  The output is listed from the command, show interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include B.W. The bandwidth is 1,544 kilo b.p.s.  This is followed with the output from the command, show i.p. O.S.P.F. interface serial zero slash zero slash one pipe include cost. The cost is 15,625.Figure two is a table summarizing the C.L.I. commands of the two methods used in modifying the costs of the serial links in the O.S.P.F. reference topology.</div>
