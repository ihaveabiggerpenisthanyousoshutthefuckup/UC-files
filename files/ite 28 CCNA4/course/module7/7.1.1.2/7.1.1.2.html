        <h1>The Converged Network and Things</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Cisco estimates that 99 percent of things in the physical world are currently unconnected. Therefore, the IoT will experience tremendous growth as we connect more of the unconnected.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many things are currently connected using a loose collection of independent, use-specific networks, as shown in the figure. For example, today’s cars have multiple proprietary networks to control engine function, safety features, and communications systems. Converging these systems alone onto a common network would save over 50 lbs. (23 kg) of cable in a modern full-size sedan. Other examples include commercial and residential buildings, which have various control systems and networks for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), telephone service, security, and lighting.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These dissimilar networks are converging to share the same infrastructure. This infrastructure includes comprehensive security, analytics, and management capabilities. The connection of the components into a converged network that uses IoT technologies increases the power of the network to help people improve their daily lives.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows how many things are loosely connected using independent, use-specific networks. The networks are HVAC, telephone, power, data, video, and physical security. A caption reads “As the IoT evolves, individual networks will be connected together and will include security, analytics, and management.”</div>
