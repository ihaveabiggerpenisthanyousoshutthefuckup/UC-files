          <p>These are the three core components of the ACI architecture:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Application Network Profile (ANP)</b> - An ANP is a collection of end-point groups (EPG), their connections, and the policies that define those connections. The EPGs shown in the figure, such as VLANs, Web services, and applications, are just examples. An ANP is often much more complex.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)</b> – The APIC is considered to be the brains of the ACI architecture. APIC is a centralized software controller that manages and operates a scalable ACI clustered fabric. It is designed for programmability and centralized management. It translates application policies into network programming.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches</b> – These switches provide an application-aware switching fabric and work with an APIC to manage the virtual and physical network infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the APIC is positioned between the APN and the ACI-enabled network infrastructure. The APIC translates the application requirements into a network configuration to meet those needs.</p>
