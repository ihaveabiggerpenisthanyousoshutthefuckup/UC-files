        <h1>Chapter 7: EIGRP Tuning and Troubleshooting</h1>
        <div>
          <p>EIGRP is one of the routing protocols commonly used in large enterprise networks. Modifying EIGRP features and troubleshooting problems is one of the most essential skills for a network engineer involved in the implementation and maintenance of large routed enterprise networks that use EIGRP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Summarization decreases the number of entries in routing updates and lowers the number of entries in local routing tables. It also reduces bandwidth utilization for routing updates and results in faster routing table lookups. EIGRP for IPv4 automatic summarization is disabled by default beginning with Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M and 12.2(33). Prior to this, automatic summarization was enabled by default. To enable automatic summarization for EIGRP use the<b> auto-summary </b>command in router configuration mode. Use the<b> show ip protocols</b> command to verify the status of automatic summarization. Examine the routing table to verify that automatic summarization is working.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>EIGRP automatically includes summary routes to Null0 to prevent routing loops that are included in the summary but do not actually exist in the routing table. The Null0 interface is a virtual IOS interface that is a route to nowhere, commonly known as "the bit bucket". Packets that match a route with a Null0 exit interface are discarded. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One method of propagating a default route within the EIGRP routing domain is to use the<b> redistribute static </b>command. This command tells EIGRP to include this static route in its EIGRP updates to other routers. The<b> show ip protocols </b>command verifies that static routes within the EIGRP routing domain are being redistributed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the<b> ip bandwidth-percent eigrp </b><i>as-number percent </i>interface configuration mode command to configure the percentage of bandwidth that can be used by EIGRP on an interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To configure the percentage of bandwidth that can be used by EIGRP for IPv6 on an interface, use the<b> ipv6 bandwidth-percent eigrp </b>command in interface configuration mode. To restore the default value, use the<b> no </b>form of this command.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Hello intervals and hold times are configurable on a per-interface basis in EIGRP and do not have to match with other EIGRP routers to establish or maintain adjacencies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For IP in EIGRP, Cisco IOS software applies load balancing using up to four equal-cost paths by default. With the<b> maximum-paths </b>router configuration mode command, up to 32 equal-cost routes can be kept in the routing table. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show ip route </b>command verifies that the router learned EIGRP routes. The<b> show ip protocols</b> command is used to verify that EIGRP displays the currently configured values.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers directly connected.  Router one has 3 subnets, the one seventy two dot sixteen dot one dot zero slash twenty four, the one seventy two dot sixteen dot two dot zero slash twenty four and the one seventy two dot sixteen dot three dot zero slash twenty four.  E. I. G. R. P. will automatically summarize these subnets to the classful boundary of one seventy two dot sixteen dot zero dot zero slash sixteen since these are subnets of a class B. network.</div>
