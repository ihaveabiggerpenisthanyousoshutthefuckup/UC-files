Figure 1 show the architecture for Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) on a layer 3 switch. In the figure are four rectangles. At the top is a rectangle depicting the control plane. The control plane rectangle has three gears and the word CPU. Below the control plane are three more rectangles. From left to right, they are the ingress interface, the data plane, which is directly below the control plane, and the egress interface. Five arrows go from left to right, each depicting a different IP packet. The arrows enter the ingress interface on the left, pass through the data plane and through a figure that is the FIB and adjacency table, and finally through the egress interface as they exit the diagram. Figure 2 shows the control plane and data plane functionality. The figure displays the centralized controller with the control plane. The control plane has arrows leading to a stack of five data planes below, one arrow to each data plane, with the words, “Forwarding instructions are sent by the controller to each device.”
