          <p>The VLAN architecture simplifies network maintenance and improves performance, but it also opens the door to abuse. There are a variety of VLAN related attacks that exist. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure illustrates one type of VLAN threat which is the switch spoofing attack. The attacker attempts to gain VLAN access by configuring a host to spoof a switch and use the 802.1Q trunking protocol and the Cisco-proprietary Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) feature to trunk with the connecting switch. If successful and the switch establishes a trunk link with the host and the attacker can then access all the VLANS on the switch and hop (i.e., send and receive) traffic on all the VLANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are several ways to mitigate VLAN attacks:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explicitly configure access links</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Explicitly disable auto trunking</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Manually enable trunk links</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Disable unused ports, make them access ports, and assign them to a black hole VLAN</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Change the default native VLAN </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implement port security</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
