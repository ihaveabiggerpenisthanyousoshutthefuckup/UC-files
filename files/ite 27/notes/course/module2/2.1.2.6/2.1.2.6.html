        <h1>Step 5 – Verify that the VTP Clients Have Received the New VLAN Information</h1>
        <div>
          <p>On S2, verify that the VLANs configured on S1 have been received and entered into the S2 VLAN database using the <b>show vlan brief</b> command, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>As expected, the VLANs configured on the VTP server have propagated to S2. Verify the VTP status on S2, as shown in Figure 2. </p>
          <p>Notice that the configuration revision number on S2 is the same as the number on the VTP server.</p>
          <p>Because S2 is operating in VTP client mode, attempts to configure VLANs will not be allowed, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to configure and verify VTP.</p>
