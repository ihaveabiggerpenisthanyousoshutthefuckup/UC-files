          <p>In the figure, the 192.168.11.0/24 network can use Telnet to connect to 192.168.30.0/24, but according to company policy, this connection should not be allowed. The results of the <b>show access-lists 130</b> command indicate that the permit statement has been matched.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Solution </b>- The 192.168.11.0/24 network can use Telnet to connect to the 192.168.30.0/24 network because the Telnet port number in statement 10 of access list 130 is listed in the wrong position in the ACL statement. Statement 10 currently denies any source packet with a port number that is equal to Telnet. To deny Telnet traffic inbound on G0/1, deny the destination port number that is equal to Telnet, for example, <b>10 deny tcp 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 eq telnet</b>.</p>
