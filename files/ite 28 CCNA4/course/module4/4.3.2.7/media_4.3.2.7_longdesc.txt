Figure shows the standard Live Equipment Lab graphic, indicating there is a live equipment lab for this section of the curriculum. The lab topology is a 3 router scenario. On the left P.C.A. connects to F0/6 on S1. S1 port F0/5 connects to G0/1 interface on R1. S 0/0/0 (which is labeled with D.C.E.) connects to interface S0/0/0 on the I.S.P. router. Interface S0/0/1 (labeled D.C.E.) connects to interface S0/0/1 on R3. R3 also has a connection to port F0/5 on S3 through interface G0/1. S3 has P.C.C attached through port F0/18.
