          <p>A business can use private lines or the public network infrastructure for WAN connections. A public infrastructure connection can be a cost-effective alternative to a private connection between LANs, as long as security is also planned.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>WAN access standards operate at Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model, and are defined and managed by the TIA/EIA, ISO, and IEEE. A WAN may be circuit-switched or packet-switched.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is common terminology used to identify the physical components of WAN connections and who, the service provider or the customer, is responsible for which components. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Service provider networks are complex and the service providerâ€™s backbone networks consist primarily of high-bandwidth fiber-optic media. The device used for interconnection to a customer is specific to the WAN technology that is implemented.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Permanent, dedicated point-to-point connections are provided by using leased lines. Dialup access, although slow, is still viable for remote areas with limited WAN options. Other private connection options include ISDN, Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet WAN, MPLS, and VSAT. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Public infrastructure connections include DSL, cable, wireless, and 3G/4G cellular. Security over public infrastructure connections can be provided by using remote-access or site-to-site Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p>
