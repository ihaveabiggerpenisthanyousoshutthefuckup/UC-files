This figure shows SDN operation. At the center is an OpenFlow switch. Inside the OpenFlow switch are six boxes, three on top and three below. Starting at the bottom, are three boxes, each labeled Flow Table. There is an arrow pointing from the left Flow Table to the center Flow Table and then to the right most Flow Table. The Flow Table matches incoming packets to a particular flow and specifies the functions that are to be performed on the packets. There may be multiple flow tables that operate in a pipeline fashion. The top three boxes depict the Meter Table, Group Table and Secure Channel software. The Meter Table can trigger a variety of performance-related actions on a flow. The Group Table may take a variety of actions triggered by a flow from the Flow Table. The terms Hardware and Firmware are inside the OpenFlow Switch. The OpenFlow switch has a series of arrows connecting it to other devices in the diagram. There are three arrows pointing to three end systems below displayed as host computers. From the OpenFlow switch there is a two-way arrow pointing to the right to two other OpenFlow switches. All three OpenFlow switches have a two-way arrow pointing to an SDN controller depicted by a computer server, communicating using the OpenFlow protocol over SSL.
