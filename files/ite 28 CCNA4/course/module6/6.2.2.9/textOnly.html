          <p>Traffic shaping and traffic policing are two mechanisms provided by Cisco IOS QoS software to prevent congestion.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Traffic shaping retains excess packets in a queue and then schedules the excess for later transmission over increments of time. The result of traffic shaping is a smoothed packet output rate, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Shaping implies the existence of a queue and of sufficient memory to buffer delayed packets, while policing does not.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ensure that you have sufficient memory when enabling shaping. In addition, shaping requires a scheduling function for later transmission of any delayed packets. This scheduling function allows you to organize the shaping queue into different queues. Examples of scheduling functions are CBWFQ and LLQ.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Shaping is an outbound concept; packets going out an interface get queued and can be shaped. In contrast, policing is applied to inbound traffic on an interface. When the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate, excess traffic is dropped (or remarked). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Policing is commonly implemented by service providers to enforce a contracted customer information rate (CIR). However, the service provider may also allow bursting over the CIR if the service providerâ€™s network is not currently experiencing congestion.</p>
