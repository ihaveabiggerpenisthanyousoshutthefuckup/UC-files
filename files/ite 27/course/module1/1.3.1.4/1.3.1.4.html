        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The hierarchical network design model divides network functionality into the access layer, the distribution layer, and the core layer.  The campus wired LAN enables communications between devices in a building or group of buildings, as well as interconnection to the WAN and internet edge at the network core.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A well-designed network controls traffic and limits the size of failure domains. Routers and switches can be deployed in pairs so that the failure of a single device does not cause service disruptions.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A network design should include an IP addressing strategy, scalable, and fast-converging routing protocols, appropriate Layer 2 protocols, and modular or clustered devices that can be easily upgraded to increase capacity. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A mission-critical server should have a connection to two different access layer switches. It should have redundant modules when possible, and a power backup source. It may be appropriate to provide multiple connections to one or more ISPs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Security monitoring systems and IP telephony systems must have high availability and often have special design considerations.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important to deploy the appropriate type of routers and switches for a given set of requirements, features and specifications, and expected traffic flow.</p>
