        <div>
          <p>The IoT refers to the network of billons of physical objects accessible through the Internet as we continue to connect the unconnected. The challenge for IoT is to securely integrate new things from multiple vendors into existing networks. The six pillars of IoT are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Network Connectivity</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fog Computing</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Security</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data Analytics</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Management and Automation</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Application Enablement Platform</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cloud computing involves large numbers of computers connected through a network that can be physically located anywhere. Cloud computing, with its “pay-as-you-go” model, allows organizations to treat computing and storage expenses more as a utility rather than investing in infrastructure. Cloud computing services include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>IT as a Service (ITaaS)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cloud models include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Public clouds</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Private clouds</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hybrid clouds</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Community clouds</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cloud computing is possible because of data centers. A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components. Data centers rely heavily on virtualization to provide cloud computing services. Cloud computing separates the application from the hardware. Virtualization separates the OS from the hardware. This allows cloud computing customers to dynamically provision the compute resources they need when they need them.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Virtualized server hardware is managed through a hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisors are installed directly on the hardware. Then any OSs and VMs can be installed. Type 2 hypervisors, such as Mac OS X Parallels or Oracle VM VirtualBox, are installed on top of any existing OS. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SDN is a network architecture that has been developed to virtualize the network. For example, SDN can virtualize the control plane. Also known as controller-based SDN, SDN moves the control plane from each network device to a central network intelligence and policy-making entity called the SDN controller. The SDN controller defines the data flows that occur in the SDN data plane. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The three types of SDN are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Device-based SDN</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Controller-based SDN</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Policy-based SDN</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Policy-based SDN, such as Cisco’s APIC-EM, is the most robust, providing for a simple mechanism to control and manage policies across the entire network. One of the most important features of the APIC-EM controller is the ability to manage policies across the entire network.</p>
