          <p>Dynamic routing protocols are used by routers to facilitate the exchange of routing information between routers. The purpose of dynamic routing protocols includes: discovery of remote networks, maintaining up-to-date routing information, choosing the best path to destination networks, and the ability to find a new best path if the current path is no longer available. While dynamic routing protocols require less administrative overhead than static routing, they do require dedicating part of a router’s resources for protocol operation, including CPU time and network link bandwidth. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Networks typically use a combination of both static and dynamic routing. Dynamic routing is the best choice for large networks and static routing is better for stub networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When there is a change in the topology routing protocols propagate that information throughout the routing domain. The process of bringing all routing tables to a state of consistency, where all of the routers in the same routing domain or area have complete and accurate information about the network, is called convergence. Some routing protocols converge faster than others.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Metrics are used by routing protocols to determine the best path or shortest path to reach a destination network. Different routing protocols may use different metrics. Typically, a lower metric means a better path. Metrics used by dynamic routing protocols include hops, bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routing protocols can be classified as either classful or classless, distance-vector or link-state, and either an interior gateway protocol or an exterior gateway protocol. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Distance vector protocols use routers as “sign posts” along the path to the final destination. The only information a router knows about a remote network is the distance or metric to reach that network and which path or interface to use to get there. Distance vector routing protocols do not have an actual map of the network topology. Modern distance vector protocols are RIPv2, RIPng and EIGRP. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A router configured with a link-state routing protocol can create a complete view or topology of the network by gathering information from all of the other routers. This information is collected using link-state packets (LSPs).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Link-state routing protocols apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the best path route. The algorithm is commonly referred to as the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm. This algorithm uses accumulated costs along each path, from source to destination, to determine the total cost of a route. The link-state routing protocols are IS-IS and OSPF.</p>
