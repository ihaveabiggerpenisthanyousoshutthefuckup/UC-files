          <p>To help explain how virtualization works, it is useful to use layers of abstraction in computer architectures. A computer system consists of the following abstraction layers, as illustrated in Figure 1:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Services</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>OS</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Firmware</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hardware</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At each of these layers of abstraction, some type of programming code is used as an interface between the layer below and the layer above. For example, the C programming language is often used to program the firmware that accesses the hardware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An example of virtualization is shown in Figure 2. A hypervisor is installed between the firmware and the OS. The hypervisor can support multiple instances of OSs.</p>
