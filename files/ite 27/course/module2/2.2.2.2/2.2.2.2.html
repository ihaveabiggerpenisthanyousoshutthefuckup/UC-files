        <h1>Verifying IP Address and Subnet Mask Configuration Issues</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each interface, or subinterface, must be assigned an IP address corresponding to the subnet to which it is connected. A common error is to incorrectly configure an IP address for a subinterface. Figure 1 displays the output of the<b> show running-config </b>command. The highlighted area shows that subinterface G0/0.10 on router R1 has an IPv4 address of 172.17.20.1. The VLAN for this subinterface should support VLAN 10 traffic. The IPv4 address has been configured incorrectly. The<b> show ip interface </b>command is useful in this setting. The second highlight shows the incorrect IPv4 address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sometimes it is the end-user device, such as a personal computer, that is improperly configured. Figure 2 shows the displayed IPv4 configuration for PC1. The IPv4 address is 172.17.20.21, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. But in this scenario, PC1 should be in VLAN 10, with an address of 172.17.10.21 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Although configuring subinterface IDs to match the VLAN number makes it easier to manage inter-VLAN configuration, it is not a requirement. When troubleshooting addressing issues, ensure that the subinterface is configured with the correct address for that VLAN.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one displays the output of the, show running-config command with emphasis on a misconfigured I.p. address for a subinterface. Figure two shows the output of the command, i.p.config on a windows host with emphasis on a misconfigured i.p. address on the network interface. A callout indicates that the p.c. should have an i.p. address within the proper subnet in order to properly communicate on the network.</div>
