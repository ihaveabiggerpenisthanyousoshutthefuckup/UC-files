        <h1>Cloud Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Cloud services are available in a variety of options, tailored to meet customer requirements. The three main cloud computing services defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their Special Publication 800-145 are as follows:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b>: The cloud provider is responsible for access to services, such as email, communication, and Office 365 that are delivered over the Internet. The user is only needs to provide their data.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b>: The cloud provider is responsible for access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>: The cloud provider is responsible for access to the network equipment, virtualized network services, and supporting network infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, cloud service providers have extended this model to also provide IT support for each of the cloud computing services (ITaaS).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For businesses, ITaaS can extend the capability of IT without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on demand and delivered economically to any device anywhere in the world without compromising security or function.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure is a cloud with interactive components about the four cloud Computing services that are available, which include Saas, PaaS, IaaS, and ITaaS. SaaS – Software as a service is where applications are delivered over the web to the end users. PaaS – Platform as a Service is where tools and services are used to deliver applications. IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service is the hardware and software used to power servers, storage, networks, and operating systems. ITaaS – IT as a Service is where IT professional support applications, platforms, and Infrastructure.</div>
