          <p>The output of the<b> show interfaces serial </b>command displays information specific to serial interfaces. Add the specific interface number you wish to investigate, such as <b>show interface serial 0/0/0</b>. When HDLC is configured, “encapsulation HDLC” should be reflected in the output, as highlighted in Figure 1. “Serial 0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up”, indicates that the line is up and functioning; “encapsulation HDLC”, indicates that the default serial encapsulation (HDLC) is enabled.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show interfaces serial</b> command returns one of six possible states: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is up, line protocol is up </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is down, line protocol is down </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is up, line protocol is down </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is up, line protocol is up (looped) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is up, line protocol is down (disabled) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Serial x is administratively down, line protocol is down</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Of the six possible states, there are five problem states. Figure 2 lists the five problem states, the issues associated with that state, and how to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<b> show controllers </b>command is another important diagnostic tool when troubleshooting serial lines, as shown in Figure 3. The output indicates the state of the interface channels and whether a cable is attached to the interface. In the figure, interface serial 0/0/0 has a V.35 DCE cable attached. The command syntax varies, depending on the platform. Cisco 7000 series routers use a cBus controller card for connecting serial links. With these routers, use the<b> show controllers cbus </b>command. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the electrical interface output displays as “UNKNOWN” instead of “V.35”, “EIA/TIA-449”, or some other electrical interface type, the likely problem is an improperly connected cable. A problem with the internal wiring of the card is also possible. If the electrical interface is unknown, the corresponding display for the<b> show interfaces serial </b>command shows that the interface and line protocol are down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 4 to practice troubleshooting a serial interface.</p>
