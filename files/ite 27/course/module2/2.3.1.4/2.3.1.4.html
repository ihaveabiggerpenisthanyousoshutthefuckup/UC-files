            <b>Routed Ports and Access Ports on a Switch</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A routed port is a physical port that acts similarly to an interface on a router. Unlike an access port, a routed port is not associated with a particular VLAN. A routed port behaves like a regular router interface. Also, because Layer 2 functionality has been removed, Layer 2 protocols, such as STP, do not function on a routed interface. However, some protocols, such as LACP and EtherChannel, do function at Layer 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike Cisco IOS routers, routed ports on a Cisco IOS switch do not support subinterfaces.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routed ports are used for point-to-point links. Connecting WAN routers and security devices are examples of the use of routed ports. In a switched network, routed ports are mostly configured between switches in the core and distribution layer. The figure illustrates an example of routed ports in a campus switched network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To configure routed ports, use the<b> no switchport </b>interface configuration mode command on the appropriate ports. For example, the default configuration of the interfaces on Catalyst 3560 switches are Layer 2 interfaces, so they must be manually configured as routed ports. In addition, assign an IP address and other Layer 3 parameters as necessary. After assigning the IP address, verify that IP routing is globally enabled and that applicable routing protocols are configured. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Routed ports are not supported on Catalyst 2960 Series switches.</p>
