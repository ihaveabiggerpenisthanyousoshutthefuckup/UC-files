          <p>SPAN allows administrators to troubleshoot network issues. For example, a network application may be taking too long to execute tasks. To investigate, a network administrator may use SPAN to duplicate and redirect traffic to a packet analyzer such as Wireshark. The administrator can then analyze the traffic from all devices to troubleshoot sub-optimal operation of the network application.</p>

          <p>Older systems with faulty NICs can also cause issues. If SPAN is enabled on a switch to send traffic to a packet analyzer, a network technician can detect and isolate the end device causing the excess traffic, as shown in the figure. </p>
