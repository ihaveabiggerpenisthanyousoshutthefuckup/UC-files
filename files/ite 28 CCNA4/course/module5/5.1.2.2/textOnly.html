          <p>The simplest and most effective method to prevent MAC table flooding attacks is to enable port security. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Port security allows an administrator to statically specify MAC addresses for a port, or to permit the switch to dynamically learn a limited number of MAC addresses. By limiting the number of permitted MAC addresses on a port to one, port security can be used to control unauthorized expansion of the network, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When MAC addresses are assigned to a secure port, the port does not forward frames with source MAC addresses outside the group of defined addresses. When a port configured with port security receives a frame, the source MAC address of the frame is compared to the list of secure source addresses that were manually configured, or auto configured (learned), on the port.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a port is configured as a secure port and the maximum number of MAC addresses is reached, any additional attempts to connect by unknown MAC addresses will generate a security violation. The figure summarizes these points.</p>
