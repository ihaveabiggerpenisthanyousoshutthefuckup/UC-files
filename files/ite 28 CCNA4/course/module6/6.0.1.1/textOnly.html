But if the traffic exceeds the bandwidth of the links between the source of the content and the user, how do network administrators ensure a quality experience? Quality of Service (QoS) tools can be designed into the network to guarantee that certain traffic types, such as voice and video, are prioritized over traffic that is not as time-sensitive, such as email and web browsing. </p>

          <p>This chapter describes network transmission quality, traffic characteristics, queueing algorithms, QoS models, and QoS implementation techniques.</p>
