        <h1>Inter-VLAN Routing with Switch Virtual Interfaces (Cont.)</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An SVI is a virtual interface that is configured within a multilayer switch, as shown in the figure. An SVI can be created for any VLAN that exists on the switch. An SVI is considered to be virtual because there is no physical port dedicated to the interface. It can perform the same functions for the VLAN as a router interface would, and can be configured in much the same way as a router interface (i.e., IP address, inbound/outbound ACLs, etc.). The SVI for the VLAN provides Layer 3 processing for packets to or from all switch ports associated with that VLAN.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By default, an SVI is created for the default VLAN (VLAN 1) to permit remote switch administration. Additional SVIs must be explicitly created. SVIs are created the first time the VLAN interface configuration mode is entered for a particular VLAN SVI, such as when the<b> interface vlan 10 </b>command is entered. The VLAN number used corresponds to the VLAN tag associated with data frames on an 802.1Q encapsulated trunk or to the VLAN ID (VID) configured for an access port. When creating an SVI as a gateway for VLAN 10, name the SVI interface VLAN 10. Configure and assign an IP address to each VLAN SVI.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Whenever the SVI is created, ensure that particular VLAN is present in the VLAN database. In the figure, the switch should have VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 present in the VLAN database; otherwise, the SVI interface stays down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following are some of the reasons to configure SVI:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To provide a gateway for a VLAN so that traffic can be routed into or out of that VLAN</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To provide Layer 3 IP connectivity to the switch</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To support routing protocol and bridging configurations</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following are some of the advantages of SVIs (the only disadvantage is that multilayer switches are more expensive):</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is much faster than router-on-a-stick, because everything is hardware switched and routed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>No need for external links from the switch to the router for routing.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Not limited to one link. Layer 2 EtherChannels can be used between the switches to get more bandwidth.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Latency is much lower, because data does not need to leave the switch in order to be routed to a different network.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure demonstrates two scenarios. One scenario indicates two hosts belonging to two different V.lans and each v.lan requiring a router in order to allow them to communicate with each other. The second scenario demonstrates that a layer 3 switch has been used in place of the router and that two switched virtual interfaces have been created to permit inter-v.lan routing.</div>
