The figure in the Packet tracer lab shows a two router scenario. The two routers connect to one another through an Ethernet connection. R1 has two LANs with hosts attached. One LAN connects to the top left of R1 and contains P.C.-A, P.C.-B, and S1. The second LAN on R1 has P.C.-C, P.C.-D, and S2. R2 has two LANs with host attached. One LAN connects to the top right of R2 and contains P.C.-E, P.C.-F, and S3. The other LAN contains P.C.-G, P.C.-H, and S4.
