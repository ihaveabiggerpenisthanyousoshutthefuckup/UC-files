        <h1>Disadvantages of Link-State Protocols</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As summarized in figure 1 link-state protocols also have a few disadvantages compared to distance vector routing protocols:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Memory Requirements </b>- Link-state protocols require additional memory to create and maintain the link-state database and SPF tree.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Processing Requirements </b>- Link-state protocols can also require more CPU processing than distance vector routing protocols. The SPF algorithm requires more CPU time than distance vector algorithms such as Bellman-Ford, because link-state protocols build a complete map of the topology. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Bandwidth Requirements </b>- The flooding of link-state packets can adversely affect the available bandwidth on a network. This should only occur during initial startup of routers, but can also be an issue on unstable networks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>However, modern link-state routing protocols are designed to minimize the effects on memory, CPU, and bandwidth. The use and configuration of multiple areas can reduce the size of the link-state databases. Multiple areas can limit the amount of link-state information flooding in a routing domain and send LSPs only to those routers that need them. When there is a change in the topology, only those routers in the affected area receive the LSP and run the SPF algorithm. This can help isolate an unstable link to a specific area in the routing domain. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, in figure 2, there are three separate routing domains: area 1, area 0, and area 51. If a network in area 51 goes down, the LSP with the information about this downed link is only flooded to other routers in that area. Only those routers in area 51 need to update their link-state databases, rerun the SPF algorithm, create a new SPF tree, and update their routing tables. Routers in other areas learn that this route is down, but this is done with a type of LSP that does not cause them to rerun their SPF algorithm. Routers in other areas can update their routing tables directly. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the disadvantages of link-state routing. Figure 2 shows three sets of five routers separated into domains called areas.  The figure highlights the fact that link state packets that originate in one area are not flooded to other areas.  For example, if a link in one area fails only other routers in that area will receive an update link state packet regarding the failed link.</div>
