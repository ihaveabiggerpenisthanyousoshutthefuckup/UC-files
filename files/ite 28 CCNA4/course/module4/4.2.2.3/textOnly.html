          <p>The example shown in Figure 1 denies FTP traffic from subnet 192.168.11.0 that is going to subnet 192.168.10.0, but permits all other traffic. Remember that FTP uses TCP ports 20 and 21; therefore, the ACL requires both port name keywords <b>ftp</b> and <b>ftp-data</b> or <b>eq 20</b> and <b>eq 21</b> to deny FTP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If using port numbers instead of port names, the commands would be written as:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <span class="cmd">
              <b>access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 20</b>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="cmd">
              <b>access-list 101 deny tcp 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 21</b>
            </span>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To prevent the implied <b>deny any</b> statement at the end of the ACL from blocking all traffic, the <b>permit ip any any</b> statement is added. Without at least one <b>permit</b> statement in an ACL, all traffic on the interface where that ACL was applied would be dropped. The ACL should be applied inbound on the G0/1 interface so that traffic from the 192.168.11.0/24 LAN is filtered as it enters the router interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example shown in Figure 2, denies Telnet traffic from any source to the 192.168.11.0/24 LAN, but allows all other IP traffic. Because traffic destined for the 192.168.11.0/24 LAN is outbound on interface G0/1, the ACL would be applied to G0/1 using the <b>out</b> keyword. Note the use of the <b>any</b> keywords in the permit statement. This permit statement is added to ensure that no other traffic is blocked. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The examples in Figures 1 and 2 both use the <b>permit ip any any</b> statement at the end of the ACL. For greater security the <b>permit 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 any</b> command may be used.</p>
