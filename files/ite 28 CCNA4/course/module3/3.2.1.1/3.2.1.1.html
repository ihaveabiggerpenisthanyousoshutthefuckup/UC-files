        <h1>PPPoE Motivation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In addition to understanding the various technologies available for broadband Internet access, it is also important to understand the underlying data link layer protocol used by the ISP to form a connection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A commonly used data link layer protocol by ISPs is PPP. PPP can be used on all serial links including those links created with dial-up analog and ISDN modems. To this day, the link from a dialup user to an ISP, using analog modems, likely uses PPP. Figure 1 shows a basic representation of that analog dial connection with PPP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Additionally, ISPs often use PPP as the data link protocol over broadband connections. There are several reasons for this. First, PPP supports the ability to assign IP addresses to remote ends of a PPP link. With PPP enabled, ISPs can use PPP to assign each customer one public IPv4 address. More importantly, PPP supports CHAP authentication. ISPs often want to use CHAP to authenticate customers because during authentication, ISPs can check accounting records to determine whether the customerâ€™s bill is paid, prior to letting the customer connect to the Internet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These technologies came to market in the following order, with varying support for PPP:</p>
          <p>1. Analog modems for dialup that could use PPP and CHAP</p>
          <p>2. ISDN for dialup that could use PPP and CHAP</p>
          <p>3. DSL, which did not create a point-to-point link and could not support PPP and CHAP</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ISPs value PPP because of the authentication, accounting, and link management features. Customers appreciate the ease and availability of the Ethernet connection. However, Ethernet links do not natively support PPP. PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) provides a solution to this problem. As shown in Figure 2, PPPoE allows the sending of PPP frames encapsulated inside Ethernet frames.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows PPP frames over legacy dialup connection. PC1 connects to a Telco/ISP cloud. This line is labeled telephone line (to POTS). Above the line are two adjacent squares. The left square is labeled PPP and the right square IP packet. There is an arrow pointing from the IP packet square towards the Telco/ISP cloud. A lightning bolt WAN connection goes from the Telco/ISP cloud to a cloud labeled Internet. At the bottom of the figure, the words are In a legacy dialup scenario, PC1 reaches the Internet through the TELCO/ISP cloud by using a FAX/MODEM device. Figure 2 has PC1 connected via PPPoE to a DSL modem. The DSL modem connects through a WAN link labeled DSL to the TELCO/ISP cloud. The TELCO/ISP cloud connects to the Internet cloud. Above the PPPoE there are three adjacent rectangles labeled Ethernet, PPP, and IP packet. An arrow points from the IP packet rectangle toward the TELCO/ISP cloud. Above the DSL connection are two rectangles labeled PPP and IP packet. An arrow points from the IP packet rectangle toward the TELCO/ISP cloud. Words below the figure are PC1 connects directly to a DSL modem. In a legacy dialup scenario, PC1 reaches the Internet through the TELCO/ISP cloud by using a modem. </div>
