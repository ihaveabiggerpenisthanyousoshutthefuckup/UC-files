          <p>Over a decade ago, VMware developed a virtualizing technology that enabled a host OS to support one or more client OSs. Most virtualization technologies are now based on this technology. The transformation of dedicated servers to virtualized servers has been embraced and is rapidly being implemented in data center and enterprise networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Two major network architectures have been developed to support network virtualization:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Software Defined Networking (SDN)</b> - A network architecture that virtualizes the network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)</b> - A purpose-built hardware solution for integrating cloud computing and data center management.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>These are some other network virtualization technologies, some of which are included as components in SDN and ACI:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>OpenFlow</b> - This approach was developed at Stanford University to manage traffic between routers, switches, wireless access points, and a controller. The OpenFlow protocol is a basic element in building SDN solutions. Click <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/openflow" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about OpenFlow.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>OpenStack</b> - This approach is a virtualization and orchestration platform available to build scalable cloud environments and provide an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution. OpenStack is often used with Cisco ACI. Orchestration in networking is the process of automating the provisioning of network components such as servers, storage, switches, routers, and applications.

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Other components</b> - Other components include Interface to the Routing System (I2RS), Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL), Cisco FabricPath (FP), and IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
