        <h1>Verify eBGP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Three commands can be used to verify eBGP, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the output for Company-A’s IPv4 routing table. Notice how the origin code <b>B</b> identifies that the route was learned using BGP. Specifically, in this example, Company-A has received a BGP advertised default route from ISP-1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows the output of Company-A’s BGP table. The first entry 0.0.0.0 with a next hop of 209.165.201.1 is the default route advertised by ISP-1. The AS path displays the single AS of 65001 because the 0.0.0.0/0 network advertised by ISP-1, originated from the same AS. Most BGP table entries show multiple autonomous system numbers in the path, listing the sequence of AS numbers required to reach the destination network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The second entry 198.133.219.0/24 is the network advertised by the Company-A router to ISP-1. The next hop address of 0.0.0.0 indicates that the 198.133.219.0/24 network originated from this router.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 4 displays the status of BGP connection on Company-A. The first line displays the local IPv4 address used to peer with another BGP neighbor and this router’s local AS number. The address and AS number of the remote BGP neighbor is shown at the bottom of the output.</p>
          <p>Use the Syntax Checker in Figure 5 to practice configuring and verifying BGP.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 has a 2 column table with a command in the left column and the description in the right column. The first command is show ip route which is used to verify routes advertised by the BGP neighbor are present in the IPv4 routing table. The next command is show ip bgp which is used to verify that received and advertised IPv4 networks are in the BGP table. The last command is show ip bgp summary which is used to verify BGP neighbors and other BGP information. Figure 2 shows how the edge router in AS 65000 Company-A received a default route through the BGP routing protocol via the neighbor router’s 209.165.201.1 interface. Figure 3 shows the Company-A router’s BGP table. The columns in the table are from the left to right: network, next hop, metric, locprf, weight, and path. The first entry is 0.0.0.0, 209.165.201.1 0, 0, 65001. The second entry is 198.133.219.0/24 0.0.0.0, 0, 32768, i. Figure 4 has the show ip bgp summary command output that includes the BGP router identifier for the Company-A router as 209.165.201.2, local AS number 65000. It also shows that IP address 209.165.201.1 is a neighbor and is in AS 65001. Figure 5 is the syntax checker to configure and verify eBGP.  </div>
