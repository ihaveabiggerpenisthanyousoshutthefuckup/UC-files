        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As the number of switches increases on a small- or medium-sized business network, the overall administration required to manage VLANs and trunks in a network becomes a challenge. This chapter will examine some of the strategies and protocols that can be used to manage VLANs and trunks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) reduces administration in a switched network. A switch in VTP server mode can manage additions, deletions and renaming of VLANs across the domain. For example, when a new VLAN is added on the VTP server, the VLAN information is distributed to all switches in the domain. This eliminates the need to configure the new VLAN on every switch. VTP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that is available on most of the Cisco Catalyst series products.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using VLANs to segment a switched network provides improves performance, manageability, and security. Trunks are used to carry information from multiple VLANs between devices. The Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) provides the ability for ports to automatically negotiate trunking between switches. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Since VLANs segment the network and are each on their own network or subnet, a Layer 3 process is required to allow traffic to move from one VLAN to another. This chapter examines the implementation of inter-VLAN routing using a Layer 3 switch. It also describes issues encountered when implementing VTP, DTP and inter-VLAN routing.</p>
