Figure is a flow chart depicting the A.C.L. and routing process in a router. The first box has that the frame arrives on the router interface. That box feeds into a decision box. The decision is a yes/no one and asks if the Layer 2 address matches? If no, the frame is placed into a trash can. If yes, then the decision is a yes/no one that asks if ACLs are on the interface. If no, the packet is forwarded to an outbound interface. If yes, another decision must be made to determine if there is an ACL statement list  match? If no, then the default deny statement is applied and the packet trashed. If yes, a decision must be made to permit the packet. If the packet is not to be allowed, the packet is sent to the trash can. If the packet is to be permitted, the packet is forwarded to an outbound interface. Then a yes/no decision is to be made to determine if there are any ACLs on the interface. If no, the packet is sent to a device. If yes, then a yes/no decision is to be determine if one of the statements in the ACL is a match. If no, the default deny statement is applied and the packet is trashed. If yes, the decision of whether to permit the packet is made. If no, the packet is dropped (sent to a trash can). If yes, the packet is sent to the device.
