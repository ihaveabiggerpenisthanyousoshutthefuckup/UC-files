        <h1>OSPF Two-Layer Area Hierarchy</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Multiarea OSPF is implemented in a two-layer area hierarchy:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Backbone (Transit) area </b>- An OSPF area whose primary function is the fast and efficient movement of IP packets. Backbone areas interconnect with other OSPF area types. Generally, end users are not found within a backbone area. The backbone area is also called OSPF area 0. Hierarchical networking defines area 0 as the core to which all other areas directly connect (Figure 1).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Regular (Non-backbone) area - </b>Connects users and resources. Regular areas are usually set up along functional or geographical groupings. By default, a regular area does not allow traffic from another area to use its links to reach other areas. All traffic from other areas must cross a transit area (Figure 2).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A regular area can have a number of subtypes, including a standard area, stub area, totally stubby area, and not-so-stubby area (NSSA). Stub, totally stubby, and NSSAs are beyond the scope of this chapter. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>OSPF enforces this rigid two-layer area hierarchy. The underlying physical connectivity of the network must map to the two-layer area structure, with all non-backbone areas attaching directly to area 0. All traffic moving from one area to another area must traverse the backbone area. This traffic is referred to as interarea traffic. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The optimal number of routers per area varies based on factors such as network stability, but Cisco recommends the following guidelines:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An area should have no more than 50 routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A router should not be in more than three areas.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any single router should not have more than 60 neighbors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows a LAN with three areas; Area 1, Area 0, and Area 51. Area 0 is highlighted. There is a serial connection leading from one of the routers bordering Area 1 and Area 0. The serial connection leads to the Internet cloud. The figure indicates that Area 0 is known as the backbone (transit) area. Figure two shows a LAN with three areas; Area 1, Area 0, and Area 51. The figure highlights that Area 1 and Area 51 are known as Regular (non-backbone) areas.</div>
