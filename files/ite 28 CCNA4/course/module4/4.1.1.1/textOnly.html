            <b>Note</b>: This section includes a brief review of standard IPv4 ACL operation and configuration. If you require additional review, refer to Chapter 7, Access Control Lists in the <i>Routing and Switching Essentials v6</i> course. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An ACL is a sequential list of permit or deny statements, known as access control entries (ACEs). ACEs are also commonly called ACL statements. When network traffic passes through an interface configured with an ACL, the router compares the information within the packet against each ACE, in sequential order, to determine if the packet matches one of the ACEs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IPv4 ACEs include the use of wildcard masks. A wildcard mask is a string of 32 binary digits used by the router to determine which bits of the address to examine for a match.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows how different wildcard masks filter IPv4 addresses. In the example, remember that binary 0 signifies a bit that must match, and binary 1 signifies a bit that can be ignored.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 provides three examples of wildcard masks that match subnets.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the first example the wildcard mask stipulates that every bit in the IPv4 192.168.1.1 must match exactly.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the second example, the wildcard mask stipulates that anything will match.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In the third example, the wildcard mask stipulates that any host within the 192.168.1.0/24 network will match.</p>
