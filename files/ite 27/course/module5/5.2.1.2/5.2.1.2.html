          <p>All routing protocols follow the same patterns of operation. To help illustrate this, consider the following scenario in which all three routers are running RIPv2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a router powers up, it knows nothing about the network topology. It does not even know that there are devices on the other end of its links. The only information that a router has is from its own saved configuration file stored in NVRAM. After a router boots successfully, it applies the saved configuration. If the IP addressing is configured correctly, then the router initially discovers its own directly connected networks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click Play in the figure to view an animation of the initial discovery of connected networks for each router. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice how the routers proceed through the boot up process and then discover any directly connected networks and subnet masks. This information is added to their routing tables as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>R1 adds the 10.1.0.0 network available through interface FastEthernet 0/0 and 10.2.0.0 is available through interface Serial 0/0/0.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>R2 adds the 10.2.0.0 network available through interface Serial 0/0/0 and 10.3.0.0 is available through interface Serial 0/0/1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>R3 adds the 10.3.0.0 network available through interface Serial 0/0/1 and 10.4.0.0 is available through interface FastEthernet 0/0.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With this initial information, the routers then proceed to find additional route sources for their routing tables. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three routers connected linearly through WAN links.  Router R-1 is connected to router R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  R-2 is connected to both R-1 and R-3 through serial WAN links, and therefore has two networks.  R-3 is only connected to R-2 through a serial WAN link, and it has a LAN on an Ethernet interface.  The animation shows the routing table being built as each router adds its own connected networks into the routing table.</div>
