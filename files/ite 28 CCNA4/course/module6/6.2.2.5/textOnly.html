          <p>802.1Q is the IEEE standard that supports VLAN tagging at layer 2 on Ethernet networks. When 802.1Q is implemented, two fields are added to the Ethernet Frame. As shown in Figure 1, these two fields are inserted into the Ethernet frame following the source MAC address field. </p>

          <p>The 802.1Q standard also includes the QoS prioritization scheme known as IEEE 802.1p. The 802.1p standard uses the first three bits in the Tag Control Information (TCI) field. Known as the Priority (PRI) field, this 3-bit field identifies the Class of Service (CoS) markings. Three bits means that a Layer 2 Ethernet frame can be marked with one of eight levels of priority (values 0â€“7) as displayed in Figure 2.</p>
