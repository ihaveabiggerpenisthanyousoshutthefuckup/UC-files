        <h1>Software Troubleshooting Tools</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A wide variety of software and hardware tools are available to make troubleshooting easier. These tools may be used to gather and analyze symptoms of network problems. They often provide monitoring and reporting functions that can be used to establish the network baseline.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Common software troubleshooting tools include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Network Management System Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Network management system (NMS) tools include device-level monitoring, configuration, and fault-management tools. Figure 1 shows an example display from the WhatsUp Gold NMS software. These tools can be used to investigate and correct network problems. Network monitoring software graphically displays a physical view of network devices, allowing network managers to monitor remote devices continuously and automatically. Device management software provides dynamic device status, statistics, and configuration information for key network devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Knowledge Bases</b>
          </p>
          <p>On-line network device vendor knowledge bases have become indispensable sources of information. When vendor-based knowledge bases are combined with Internet search engines like Google, a network administrator has access to a vast pool of experience-based information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the Cisco <b>Tools & Resources</b> page found at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cisco.com</a>. This page provides information on Cisco-related hardware and software. It contains troubleshooting procedures, implementation guides, and original white papers on most aspects of networking technology.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Baselining Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Many tools for automating the network documentation and baselining process are available. Figure 3 shows a screen capture of the SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor 12 baseline view. Baselining tools help with common documentation tasks. For example, they can draw network diagrams, help keep network software and hardware documentation up-to-date, and help to cost-effectively measure baseline network bandwidth use.</p>
