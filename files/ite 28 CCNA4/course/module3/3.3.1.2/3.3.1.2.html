        <h1>Benefits of VPNs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As shown in the figure, a VPN uses virtual connections that are routed through the Internet from the private network of an organization to the remote site or employee host. The information from a private network is securely transported over the public network, to form a virtual network.</p>
          <p>The benefits of a VPN include the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cost savings </b>- VPNs enable organizations to use cost-effective, third-party Internet transport to connect remote offices and remote users to the main site; therefore, eliminating expensive, dedicated WAN links and modem banks. Furthermore, with the advent of cost-effective, high-bandwidth technologies, such as DSL, organizations can use VPNs to reduce their connectivity costs while simultaneously increasing remote connection bandwidth.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Scalability </b>- VPNs enable organizations to use the Internet infrastructure within ISPs and devices, which makes it easy to add new users. Therefore, organizations are able to add large amounts of capacity without adding significant infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Compatibility with broadband technology </b>- VPNs allow mobile workers and telecommuters to take advantage of high-speed, broadband connectivity, such as DSL and cable, to access to their organizationsâ€™ networks. Broadband connectivity provides flexibility and efficiency. High-speed, broadband connections also provide a cost-effective solution for connecting remote offices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security </b>- VPNs can include security mechanisms that provide the highest level of security by using advanced encryption and authentication protocols that protect data from unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description">The figure for VPN Internet connections shows three type of VPNs connect to an Internet cloud: Branch office, mobile user, and SOHO. Each type has a pipe connection labeled VPN going into the Internet cloud. Another pipe connection goes from the Internet cloud to a building labeled Central Site. </div>
