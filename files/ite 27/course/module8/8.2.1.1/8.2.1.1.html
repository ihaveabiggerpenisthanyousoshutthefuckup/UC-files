        <h1>OSPF Network Topology</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Introduced in 1991, OSPFv2 is a link-state routing protocol for IPv4. OSPF was designed as an alternative to another IPv4 routing protocol, RIP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure shows the topology used for configuring OSPFv2 in this section. The types of serial interfaces and their associated bandwidths may not necessarily reflect the more common types of connections found in networks today. The bandwidths of the serial links used in this topology were chosen to help explain the calculation of the routing protocol metrics and the process of best path selection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The routers in the topology have a starting configuration, including interface addresses. There is currently no static routing or dynamic routing configured on any of the routers. All interfaces on routers R1, R2, and R3 (except the loopback on R2) are within the OSPF backbone area. The ISP router is used as the routing domainâ€™s gateway to the Internet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: In this topology the loopback interface is used to simulate the WAN link to the Internet. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three routers configured in a triangle. Each router is connected to the other two routers over serial WAN links.  Each router has a local LAN configured on each gigabit Ethernet interface.  One of the three routers has a loopback interface configured that is simulating a connection to the Internet.  All three routers are in O.S.P.F. area 0.  There are seven networks in the topology, and this topology will be referenced in the next few pages as the O.S.P.F. reference topology.</div>
