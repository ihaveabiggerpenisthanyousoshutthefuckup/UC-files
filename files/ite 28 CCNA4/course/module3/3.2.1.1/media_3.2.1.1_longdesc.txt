Figure 1 shows PPP frames over legacy dialup connection. PC1 connects to a Telco/ISP cloud. This line is labeled telephone line (to POTS). Above the line are two adjacent squares. The left square is labeled PPP and the right square IP packet. There is an arrow pointing from the IP packet square towards the Telco/ISP cloud. A lightning bolt WAN connection goes from the Telco/ISP cloud to a cloud labeled Internet. At the bottom of the figure, the words are In a legacy dialup scenario, PC1 reaches the Internet through the TELCO/ISP cloud by using a FAX/MODEM device. Figure 2 has PC1 connected via PPPoE to a DSL modem. The DSL modem connects through a WAN link labeled DSL to the TELCO/ISP cloud. The TELCO/ISP cloud connects to the Internet cloud. Above the PPPoE there are three adjacent rectangles labeled Ethernet, PPP, and IP packet. An arrow points from the IP packet rectangle toward the TELCO/ISP cloud. Above the DSL connection are two rectangles labeled PPP and IP packet. An arrow points from the IP packet rectangle toward the TELCO/ISP cloud. Words below the figure are PC1 connects directly to a DSL modem. In a legacy dialup scenario, PC1 reaches the Internet through the TELCO/ISP cloud by using a modem.
