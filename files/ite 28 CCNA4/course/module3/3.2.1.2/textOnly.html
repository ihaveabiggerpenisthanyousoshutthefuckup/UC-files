          <p>As shown in the figure, the customer’s router is usually connected to a DSL modem using an Ethernet cable. PPPoE creates a PPP tunnel over an Ethernet connection. This allows PPP frames to be sent across the Ethernet cable to the ISP from the customer’s router. The modem converts the Ethernet frames to PPP frames by stripping the Ethernet headers. The modem then transmits these PPP frames on the ISP’s DSL network.</p>
