Figure one shows the A.C.L. reference network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3.  R-1 has two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has only one active interface with the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 3 0 colon colon slash 64 on the gigabit zero slash one interface.  The serial WAN between R-1 and R-2 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 1 colon colon slash 64. The serial WAN between R-2 and R-3 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 2 colon colon slash 64.Figure two shows the commands used to configure each interface on R-1. The first command is, interface gig zero slash zero.  The next command is, i.p.v.6.  address 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon one slash 64.  The next interface is the serial 0 slash zero slash zero and the command for the address is, i.p.v.6. address 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 1 colon colon one slash 64.  The next interface is the gigabit Ethernet zero slash one interface, and the addressing command is, i.p.v.6.  address 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon one slash 64.  The commands are verified via the command, show i.p.v.6. interface brief.  This output lists the active i.p.v.6. interfaces and their addresses. Figure three lists the commands for configuring the addresses on router R-2.Figure four lists the commands for configuring the addresses on router R-3. Interface s0/0/1, ipv6 address 2001:d.b.8:feed:2::1/64, exit, interface g0/0, ipv6 address 2001:d.b.8:caf√©:30::1/64, end, show i.p.v.6 interface brief. GigabitEthernet 0/0 up and up, F.E.80::F.E.99:47F.F.:F.E.71:7A20, 2001:D.B.8:C.A.F.E:30::1, Serial 0/0/1 up and up, F.E.80::F.E.99:47F.F:F.E.71:7A20, 2001:D.B.8:F.E.E.D:2::1.
