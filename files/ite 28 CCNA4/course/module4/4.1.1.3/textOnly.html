          <p>Administrators can control network traffic based on a number of characteristics, including the TCP port being requested. It is easier to understand how an ACL filters traffic by examining the dialogue that occurs during a TCP conversation, such as when requesting a webpage.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a client requests data from a web server, IP manages the communication between the PC (source) and the server (destination). TCP manages the communication between the web browser (application) and the network server software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The animation shown in Figure 1 illustrates how a TCP/IP conversation takes place. TCP segments are marked with flags that denote their purpose: a SYN starts (synchronizes) the session; an ACK is an acknowledgment that an expected segment was received, and a FIN finishes the session. A SYN/ACK acknowledges that the transfer is synchronized. TCP data segments include the higher level protocol needed to direct the application data to the correct application.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The TCP data segment also identifies the port which matches the requested service. Figure 2 shows ranges of UDP and TCP ports. Figure 3 shows a listing of well-known port numbers.</p>
