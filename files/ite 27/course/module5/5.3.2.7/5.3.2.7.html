        <h1>Building the SPF Tree</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each router in the routing area uses the link-state database and SPF algorithm to construct the SPF tree.</p>
          <p>For example, using the link-state information from all other routers, R1 can now begin to construct an SPF tree of the network. To begin, the SPF algorithm interprets each routerâ€™s LSP to identify networks and associated costs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, R1 identifies its directly connected networks and costs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figures 2 through 5, R1 keeps adding any unknown network and associated costs to the SPF tree. Notice that R1 ignores any networks it has already identified.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The SPF algorithm then calculates the shortest paths to reach each individual network resulting in the SPF tree as shown in Figure 6. R1 now has a complete topology view of the link-state area.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each router constructs its own SPF tree independently from all other routers. To ensure proper routing, the link-state databases used to construct those trees must be identical on all routers.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows router R-1 with an active Fast Ethernet interface, and connected to three other routers over each of three WAN links.  The figure shows router R-1 building its link state database.  The first step is R-1 identifying what networks it is attached to and the cost for each network on that link.  For example, R-1 is connected to network 10 dot 1 dot zero dot zero slash 16, with a cost of 2.  It is also connected to network 10 dot 2 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 20, network 10 dot 3 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 5, and network 10 dot 4 dot zero dot zero slash 16 with a cost of 20.Figure two shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-2.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure three shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-3.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure four shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-4.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure five shows router R-1 processing the information received in an L.S.P. received from router R-2.  R-1 will add any new networks to its database, but will ignore any networks that already exist in the database. Figure six shows the resulting S.P.F. tree of router R-1.  This lists each destination network, the shortest path, and the associated cost.  For example, R-1 can reach network 10 dot 5 dot zero dot zero slash 16 through router R-2 with a cost of 22.</div>
