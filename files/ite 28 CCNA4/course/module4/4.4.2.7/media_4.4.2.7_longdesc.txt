  Figure one shows the A.C.L. reference network of three routers.  R-2 is at the top of a triangle layout and has a serial WAN connection to both R-1 and R-3.  There is no direct connection between R-1 and R-3.  R-1 has two active gigabit interfaces for local network segments, and each segment has a switch with a computer connected to the switch.  R-1 has the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 0 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash zero, and the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 1 1 colon colon slash 64 on interface gigabit zero slash one.  R-3 has only one active interface with the i.p.v.6. network 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon C A F E colon 3 0 colon colon slash 64 on the gigabit zero slash one interface.  The serial WAN between R-1 and R-2 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 1 colon colon slash 64. The serial WAN between R-2 and R-3 is 2 0 0 1 colon D B 8 colon F E E D colon 2 colon colon slash 64. Figure two shows the output from the show running-config and show ipv6 access-list command. Figure three shows the command to fix change the host statement. Figure four shows the commands to reorder the A.C.L. statements.
