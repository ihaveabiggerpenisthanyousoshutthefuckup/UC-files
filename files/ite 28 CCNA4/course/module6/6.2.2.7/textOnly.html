          <p>Where should markings occur? Traffic should be classified and marked as close to its source as technically and administratively feasible. This defines the trust boundary as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trusted endpoints have the capabilities and intelligence to mark application traffic to the appropriate Layer 2 CoS and/or Layer 3 DSCP values. Examples of trusted endpoints include IP phones, wireless access points, videoconferencing gateways and systems, IP conferencing stations, and more.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Secure endpoints can have traffic marked at the Layer 2 switch.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Traffic can also be marked at Layer 3 switches / routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Re-marking of traffic is typically necessary. For example, re-marking CoS values to IP Precedent or DSCP values.</p>
