          <p>Remote SPAN (RSPAN) allows source and destination ports to be in different switches. RSPAN is useful when the packet analyzer or IPS is on a different switch than the traffic being monitored. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in Figure 1 describes RSPAN terms.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 illustrates how RSPAN is forwarded between two switches. Notice how RSPAN extends SPAN by enabling remote monitoring of multiple switches across the network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>RSPAN uses two sessions. One session is used as the source and one session is used to copy or receive the traffic from a VLAN. The traffic for each RSPAN session is carried over trunk links in a user-specified RSPAN VLAN that is dedicated (for that RSPAN session) in all participating switches. </p>
