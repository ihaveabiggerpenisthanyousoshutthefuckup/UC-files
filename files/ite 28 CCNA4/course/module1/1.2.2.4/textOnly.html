          <p>Frame Relay is a simple Layer 2 non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) WAN technology used to interconnect enterprise LANs. A single router interface can be used to connect to multiple sites using PVCs. PVCs are used to carry both voice and data traffic between a source and destination, and support data rates up to 4 Mb/s, with some providers offering even higher rates.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An edge router only requires a single interface, even when multiple virtual circuits (VCs) are used. The leased line to the Frame Relay network edge allows cost-effective connections between widely scattered LANs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Frame Relay creates PVCs which are uniquely identified by a data-link connection identifier (DLCI). The PVCs and DLCIs ensure bidirectional communication from one DTE device to another. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For instance, in the figure, R1 will use DLCI 102 to reach R2 while R2 will use DLCI 201 to reach R1.</p>
