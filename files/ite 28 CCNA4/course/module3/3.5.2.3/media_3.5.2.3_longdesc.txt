Figure 1 show when only a default route is used. A cloud labeled AS 65000 Company-A has two edge routers. One of the edge routers connects to an edge router within the AS 65001 ISP-1 cloud. The other edge router connects to an edge router within a cloud labeled AS 65002 ISP-2. The AS 65001 ISP-1 cloud and AS 65002 ISP-2 cloud both connect to the same Internet cloud. The edge router within the AS 65001 ISP-1 cloud has a default route to the edge router within the AS 65000 Company-A cloud and the connection is an eBGP one. Likewise, the edge router within the AS 65002 ISP-2 cloud has a default route configured on it pointing toward the edge router within the AS 65000 Company-A cloud. This connection between AS 65002 and AS 65001 is also an eBGP one. Figure 2 has the same topology as Figure 1. The difference is that ISP-1 sends a default routes and all the ISP-1 routes to AS 65000 Company-A. ISP-2 sends a default route and all of the ISP-2 routes. Figure 3 shows how both ISP-1 and ISP-2 routers can send a default route and all of the Internet routes to Company-A, but the two Company-A edge routers would have to be able to handle all the networks of the world.
